  Linear growth occurs when quantities increase or decrease at a constant rate over time, which is common in real-life scenarios like budgeting, population changes, and transportation. Understanding linear growth helps us make predictions, solve problems, and analyze trends in fields like science, economics, and everyday decision-making.

  <title>Linear Growth Models</title>
  <p>
    A linear growth model is an equation used to represent something that changes by the same amount in each unit of time. We use the term growth even in situations where a quantity is <em>decreasing</em> by the same amount in each unit of time. (It is growing by a negative amount.) Following are some examples of linear growth:
  </p>
  <p>
       <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A tree is 4 feet tall when it is planted, and it grows 2 feet each year.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The value of a car is $38,000 when new, and the value decreases by $2,000 each year.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The total cost to repair a dishwasher is $100 plus $80 for each hour of labor.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The population of a small town is 4,070 people in the year 2025, and it is increasing by 5 people per year.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
  <p>
  Consider the tree that starts out 4 feet tall and grows 2 feet each year. After 1 year, it will be 6 feet tall, after 2 years it will be 8 feet tall, after 3 years it will be 10 feet tall, and so on. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We can demonstrate the growth pattern with a table and a graph. 
  </p>
  <table>
    <title>Tree growth over time</title>
    <tabular row-headers="no" halign="center">
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Time (yrs)</cell>

        <cell>6</cell>
        <cell>16</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
  </table>
    <p>
    By convention, we put time on the horizontal axis when dealing with growth models. Plotting the points in the table above results in the following graph. 
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="linear-growth-points">
    <caption>Linear growth pattern</caption>
    <image source="images/modeling-linear-pts.png" width="50%">
      <shortdescription>Graph showing points in the tree growth over time table</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Note that if we connect the data points, the result would be a straight <em>line</em>, which is why we call this type of trend <term>linear growth</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine that we wanted to predict the height of the tree after 20 years. We would start with the initial height of 4 feet and add 2 feet 20 times. Mathematically, this is <m>4+2(20)=84</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Generalizing, we can obtain a formula for the height of the tree after <m>t</m> years:
  <me>
    H(t)=4+2t.
  </me>
</p>
<p>
  Recall from algebra classes that <m>H(t)</m> indicates function notation, not multiplication. We read it as "<m>H</m> of <m>t</m>".
</p>
<p>
  As expected, the graph of <m>H(t)=4+2t</m> is a straight line.
</p>

<p>
  Using a similar approach we can write linear functions to model the remaining examples mentioned above:
</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The value of the car that starts out at $38,000 and loses $2,000 in value each year can be modeled with the function
  <m>
    V(t)=38\,000-2\,000t
  </m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The $100 plus $80 per hour cost to repair the dishwasher can be modeled with the function <m>C(t)=100+80t</m> where <m>t</m> is measured in hours.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The population of the town that starts at 4,070 and grows by 5 people per year since the year 2025 can be modeled with the function <m>P(t)=4\,070+5t</m> where <m>t</m> is the number of years since 2025.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    Linear growth can be modeled with functions of the form
    <me>
      P(t)=P_0+Dt

      <li>

        <title><m>D</m></title>
        <p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <title>t</title>
        <p>
          is the amount of time.

    Note that <m>D</m> can be negative.
  </p>
</assemblage>
<p>
  <em>Is the linear growth model the same as <m>y=mx+b</m> from algebra classes?</em> Yes, it is! It isn't a problem to use a model of the form <m>y=mx+b</m> for all applications of linear growth. However, many students prefer the form above because it makes the meanings of the variables and constants clear.
</p>
<p>
  The general linear growth model equation above uses the variable <m>P</m> because population models are one of the more common applications. However, any variable may be used.
</p>
<p>
  The constant <m>P_0</m> can be read "P sub zero", "P zero", or "P naught", and it represents the population or value at time zero.
</p>

<p>
  Recall that linear growth occurs when a value changes by the same amount in each unit of time, and growth can be either positive or negative depending on whether the value is increasing or decreasing.
</p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Identify whether each scenario is an example of linear growth. If it is linear growth, find the initial value, the common difference or growth rate, and the equation.

          <li>
            <p>
              A projectile starts at ground level. It reaches its maximum height of 40 feet after two seconds and lands after four seconds. Is the height of the projectile a linear function of time?
            </p>
            <solution>
              <p>
              The height increases and then decreases. Therefore, it does not have a constant rate of change, and it is not linear. (It is quadratic.)
            </p>
            </solution>
          </li>
          <li>

              The population of a small town is 1,042 people in the year 2015, and the population grows by 19 people per year. Is the population a linear function of time?
            </p>
            <solution>
              <p>
                The growth rate is a constant 19 people per year, so this is linear growth. If we let <m>t=0</m> be the year 2015, then the initial value is <m>P_0=1\,042</m> and the growth rate is 19 people per year. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The equation is <m>P(t)=1042+19t</m>.
              </p>

              The population of a small town is 1,042 people in the year 2015, and the population grows by 2.9% per year. Is the population a linear function of time?
            </p>
            <solution>
              <p>
                The first year, the population grows by 2.9% of 1042, which is about 30 people or a new population of 1072 people. The second year, the population grows by 2.9% of 1072, which is about 31 people. The amount of growth is not the same, so this is not linear growth. (It is exponential growth.)

              For tax and planning purposes, a business estimates that a tractor purchased for $28,000 will be worth $0 after seven years of use. It depreciates by the same amount each year. Is the reported value of the tractor a linear function of time?
            </p>
            <solution>
              <p>
                This is linear because the value depreciates by the same amount each year. The initial value is <m>V_0=28\,000</m> dollars. The common difference <m>D=-\frac{28\,000}{7}=-4\,000</m> dollars each year. The resulting equation is 
              <me>
                V(t)=28\,000-4\,000t
              </me>

              The population of Poulsbo, Washington, was about 9,300 people in 2010, about 12,000 people in 2020, and about 12,200 people in 2024. Is the population of Poulsbo a linear function of time?
            </p>
            <solution>
              <p>
                To determine if this is linear growth, we will determine the growth rates from 2010 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2024 to see if they are the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 2010 to 2020, the population grew by <m>12\,000-9\,300=2700</m> people in 10 years, which is a growth rate of <m>2700/10=270</m> people per year.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 2020 to 2024, the population grew by 200 people in four years, which is a growth rate of <m>200/4=50</m> people per year. Since the growth rates are not approximately equal, the population of Poulsbo is not growing linearly.

        Kobi drives an average of 1,050 miles each month. They just purchased a used car with 43,000 miles on the odometer.

        <li>
          <p>
            Develop a linear model to represent the number of miles on the odometer after <m>t</m> months.

            <p>
              
              Measuring time in months since Kobi purchased the car, the initial value is <m>P_0=43000</m>. The common difference is <m>d=1050</m> miles per month. Therefore, we can build the model <me>P(t)=43000+1050t</me> where <m>t</m> is measured in months and <m>P</m> is the number of miles on the odometer.

              Two years is the same as <m>t=24</m> months. Substituting <m>t=24</m> into our function model and evaluating yields <m>P(24)=43000+1050(24)=68200</m> miles.

              To determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles, we set the mileage <m>P</m> equal to 100,000 and solve for <m>t</m>.
              <me>
