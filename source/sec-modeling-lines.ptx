  Linear growth occurs when quantities increase or decrease at a constant rate over time, which is common in real-life scenarios like budgeting, population changes, and transportation. Understanding linear growth helps us make predictions, solve problems, and analyze trends in fields like science, economics, and everyday decision-making.

  <title>Linear Growth Models</title>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Kobi drives an average of 1,050 miles each month. Kobi just purchased a used car with 43,000 miles on the odometer.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Develop a linear model to represent the number of miles on the odometer after <m>t</m> months.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the model to estimate the mileage after 2 years.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the model to determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Measuring time in months since Kobi purchased the car, the initial value is <m>P_0=43000</m>. The common difference is <m>d=1050</m>. Therefore, we can build the model <m>P(t)=1=43000+1050t</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Two years is the same as <m>t=24</m> months. Substituting <m>t=24</m> into our function model and evaluating yields <m>P(24)=43000+1050(24)=68200</m> miles.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles, we set the mileage <m>P</m> equal to 100,000 and solve for <m>t</m>.
              <me>
                43000+1050t=100000
              </me>
              <me>
                1050t=57000
              </me>
              <me>
                t=\frac{57000}{1050}\approx54
              </me>
              The car will have 100,000 miles on the odometer in about 54 months, or about 4.5 years.
