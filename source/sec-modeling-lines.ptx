  Linear growth occurs when quantities increase or decrease at a constant rate over time, which is common in real-life scenarios like budgeting, population changes, and transportation. Understanding linear growth helps us make predictions, solve problems, and analyze trends in fields like science, economics, and everyday decision-making.

  <title>Linear Growth Models</title>
  <p>
    A linear growth model is an equation used to represent something that changes by the same amount in each unit of time. We use the term growth even in situations where a quantity is <em>decreasing</em> by the same amount in each unit of time. (It is growing by a negative amount.) Following are some examples of linear growth:
  </p>
  <p>
       <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A tree is 4 feet tall when it is planted, and it grows 2 feet each year.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The value of a car is $38,000 when new, and the value decreases by $2,000 each year.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The total cost to repair a dishwasher is $100 plus $80 for each hour of labor.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The population of a small town is 4,070 people in the year 2025, and it is increasing by 5 people per year.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
  <p>
  Consider the tree that starts out 4 feet tall and grows 2 feet each year. After 1 year, it will be 6 feet tall, after 2 years it will be 8 feet tall, after 3 years it will be 10 feet tall, and so on. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We can demonstrate the growth pattern with a table and a graph. 
  </p>
  <table>
    <title>Tree growth over time</title>
    <tabular row-headers="no" halign="center">
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Time (yrs)</cell>
        <cell>Height (ft)</cell>

      <row>

        <cell>4</cell>
      </row>
      <row>

        <cell>6</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>2</cell>
        <cell>8</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>3</cell>
        <cell>10</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>4</cell>
        <cell>12</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>5</cell>
        <cell>14</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>6</cell>
        <cell>16</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
  </table>
    <p>
    By convention, we put time on the horizontal axis when dealing with growth models. Plotting the points in the table above results in the following graph. 
  </p>

    <image source="images/modeling-linear-pts.png" width="50%">
      <shortdescription>Graph showing points in the tree growth over time table</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Note that if we connect the data points, the result would be a straight <em>line</em>, which is why we call this type of trend <term>linear growth</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine that we wanted to predict the height of the tree after 20 years. We would start with the initial height of 4 feet and add 2 feet 20 times. Mathematically, this is <m>4+2(20)=84</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Generalizing, we can obtain a formula for the height of the tree after <m>t</m> years:
  <me>
    H(t)=4+2t.
  </me>
</p>
<p>
  Recall from algebra classes that <m>H(t)</m> indicates function notation, not multiplication. We read it as "<m>H</m> of <m>t</m>".
</p>
<p>
  As expected, the graph of <m>H(t)=4+2t</m> is a straight line.
</p>

<p>
  Using a similar approach we can write linear functions to model the remaining examples.
</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The value of the car that starts out at $38,000 and loses $2,000 in value each year can be modeled with the function
  <m>
    V(t)=38\,000-2\,000t
  </m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The $100 plus $80 per hour cost to repair the dishwasher can be modeled with the function <m>C(t)=100+80t</m> where <m>t</m> is measured in hours.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The population of the town that starts at 4,070 and grows by 5 people per year since the year 2025 can be modeled with the function <m>P(t)=4\,070+5t</m> where <m>t</m> is the number of years since 2025.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Kobi drives an average of 1,050 miles each month. They just purchased a used car with 43,000 miles on the odometer.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Develop a linear model to represent the number of miles on the odometer after <m>t</m> months.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the model to estimate the mileage after 2 years.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the model to determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Measuring time in months since Kobi purchased the car, the initial value is <m>P_0=43000</m>. The common difference is <m>d=1050</m>. Therefore, we can build the model <m>P(t)=1=43000+1050t</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Two years is the same as <m>t=24</m> months. Substituting <m>t=24</m> into our function model and evaluating yields <m>P(24)=43000+1050(24)=68200</m> miles.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles, we set the mileage <m>P</m> equal to 100,000 and solve for <m>t</m>.
              <me>
                43000+1050t=100000
              </me>
              <me>
                1050t=57000
              </me>
              <me>
                t=\frac{57000}{1050}\approx54
              </me>
              The car will have 100,000 miles on the odometer in about 54 months, or about 4.5 years.
