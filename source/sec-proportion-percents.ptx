    <title>Percents</title>
      <p>
        If you went shopping and one shirt was $20 off and another shirt was $30 off it might be hard to tell which is the
         better value. What if they were 20% off and 30% off? Percentages can make quantities easier to compare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Percent, denoted by %, means “per 100,” or “parts per hundred.” In Spanish it's literally por ciento which means
         for one hundred. When we write 30% off, that means you save 30 out of every 100 dollars. A $100 item would be $30 off, a $200 item would be $60 off, and so on. We can write this 
         percentage as the fraction <m>\frac{30}{100}</m>. When we divide 30 by 100, we get
        <me>\frac{30}{100}=0.30</me>
        We can also say you would save 30 cents out of every dollar. Many equivalent fractions can be written that equal 30%. 
        Notice that 60 out of 200 and 15 out of 50 are also 30%, since
        <me>\frac{60}{200}=\frac{15}{50}=\frac{30}{100}=0.30</me>
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          As an example, let's compare two jackets on sale and add some prices:
        </p>

        </sidebyside>
          <p>
            What is the sale price and sale percentage for each jacket? Which is the better buy?
          </p>
          <sidebyside widths="40% 40%" valign="top">
            <stack>
              <p>
                <em>Jacket 1:</em>
              </p>
            <p>
              For this jacket we have the dollar amount of the sale so we will subtract it from the original price.
            </p>
            <p>
              <me>\$80-\$20 = \$60</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we will divide to find the percentage of the sale:
              <me>\frac{\$20}{\$80} = 0.25</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              This jacket is 25% off and the sale price is $60.

              <em>Jacket 2:</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this jacket we know the percentage off so we need to find 30% of $100. We used a base of 100 so $30 off per $100 is 
              $30.
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>30\% \text{ off of } \$100 \text{ is } \$30</m>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then we subtract the sale amount from the original price to get:
              <me>\$100-30 = \$70</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              This jacket is 30% off and the sale price is $70.
            </p>
            </stack>
          </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Which do you think is the better deal? You would save more with jacket 2, but jacket 1 is cheaper. If the jackets are 
          similar in quality and desirability, jacket 1 would be a good choice. If jacket 2 is warmer, looks better on you, or offers better 
          rain protection, you might consider whether it is worth spending an additional $10 to have a better jacket.

        <title>Converting Between Percents and Decimals</title>
      <p>
        To convert a percent to decimal form, we use the definition of "per 100." For example, <m>82\%</m> means <q>82 per 100</q> so we divide by 100. Notice this is the same as moving the decimal two places to the left and removing the % symbol.
        <me>82\% = \frac{82}{100}=0.82</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        To go the other way, if we have <m>0.10</m>, we can multiply it by 100% or move the decimal two places to the right and add the % symbol.
        <me>0.10 = 0.10(100\%)=10\%</me>
      </p>
      <assemblage xml:id="percents-caution">
        <title>Caution</title>
        
          <p>
            Be careful with fractions and decimals! Banks sometimes use fractions when expressing interest rates of loans. For example, <m>6\frac{3}{4}\%</m> is the same as <m>6.75\%</m> because <m>3\div4=0.75</m>. We can convert to decimal form by moving the decimal two places to the left to obtain <m>0.0675</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be careful with small percentages! For example, <m>0.5\%</m> expressed in decimal form is <m>0.005</m>. The decimal starts out to the left of the 5, and when we shift the decimal two places to the left we must fill in with two additional zeros.

    <title>Calculating Percents</title>
    <p>
      When calculating percents, we divide the <term>part</term> by the <term>whole</term> amount. The whole amount is also called the <term>base</term> of the percentage. First we will look at how to calculate percents and then how to calculate a part.
    </p>
  
  <assemblage>
        <title>Calculating Percents</title>
        <p>
          <me>\text{Percent in decimal form} = \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\text{Part} = \text{(percent in decimal form)} \cdot \text{whole}</me>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Whole = percent <m>\cdot</m> part
        </p> -->
      </assemblage>
      <p>
        We can also think of these formulas as sentences. The word <term>is</term> means equals, <term>per</term> means divide, and <term>of</term> often means multiplication. So we can also say, <q>Percent is part per whole,</q> and, <q>Part is percent of whole.</q>
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
        <p>
          In a survey of 1,031 randomly chosen adults, 577 said they would feel better if they got more sleep (<url href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"
            visual="news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed">source</url>). What percent is this?
        </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            First, we need to identify the part and the whole. The whole is the total number of adults surveyed. The part is the 577 adults who said they would feel better if they got more sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the formula <me>\text{Percent} = \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}</me> we can calculate
              <me>\text{Percent} = \frac{577}{1013} \approx 0.570 \text{ or } 57\%</me>
          </p>
          <p>
            About 57% of the adults surveyed said they would feel better if they got more sleep.

        First estimate which quantity is the larger percentage. Then calculate both percentages.

        <ol marker="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              We are estimating that 8 out of 10 seems larger compared to 11 out of 15 because missing 2 out of 10 seems like less than 4 out of 15.

      Another useful tool is finding the part when we know the percent and the whole amount.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        For example, say you have a high yield online savings account that pays an annual interest rate of 4.5%. If you have $3000 in the account for your emergency fund, how much interest will you earn in a year? What would your total balance be with the interest?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>
        To perform calculations with percents, we change them into decimal form first. So we divide 4.5 by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and we get 0.045.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, using the formula <me>\text{Part} = \text{percent} \cdot \text{whole}</me> we have
      </p>
      <p>
        <me>\text{Part} = 0.045(\$3000) = \$135</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        You would earn $135 in interest. Interest is added to your account so we will add to find the total balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <me>\$3000+135 = \$3{,}135</me> Your total balance is $3,135 after one year.
      </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Note: The example above is an example of <term>simple interest</term>. Most accounts use something called "<term>compound interest</term>. Both types of interest are addressed in <xref ref="ch-personal-finance" />.

              <me>\$399(0.087)=\$34.71</me>
              We rounded to the nearest cent. Then we will add since the tax is an additional cost.
              <me>\$399+34.71=\$433.71</me>
              The tax on the TV is $34.71, which gives a total price of $433.71.

    <title>Percents over 100%</title>
    <p>
      In many situations the part must be less than the whole so the percent cannot be more than 100%. In the shirt sale example, a store can't take off more than the cost of the shirt. If they took off 100% of the price the shirt would be free. In other situations, going over 100% does make sense. So it's important to use the context and your number sense to make sure your answer is reasonable.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        A company set a goal of $50,000 in profit and actually made $120,000 in their first year. What percent of their goal is this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we can see the <q>part</q> is higher than the whole or base amount so this answer should be over 100%.
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = \frac{\$120{,}000}{\$50{,}000} = 2.4 \text{ or } 240\%</me>
          The company's profit was 2.4 times or 240% of their goal.

    <title>Absolute and Relative Change</title>
  
    <p>
      As we saw in the shirt sale prices, we can talk about a difference in absolute terms or relative terms. <term>Absolute change</term> is the actual amount of the change in dollars, people, etc. The change is positive if the value goes up and negative if it goes down. <term>Relative change</term> is the amount of change as a percentage of the starting amount. The relative change would have the same sign as the absolute change. Often we use words like increase or decrease to represent the sign.
    </p>

          <mrow></mrow>
          <mrow>\text{Relative Change} \amp = \frac{\text{Absolute Change}}{\text{Starting Amount}}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      For example, Portland Community College recently increased its tution from $128 to $133 per credit hour. Find the absolute and relative change. First we will subtract to find out how much the tuition went up.
      <me>\$133-\$128 = \$5\text{ per credit}</me>
      The absolute change is an increase of $5 per credit. Now we will divide that by the original tuition of $128.
      <me>\frac{\$5}{\$128}\approx 0.039</me>
      The relative change is a tuition increase of about 3.9%.
    </p>
    <p>
      The base of a percent is very important and relative change is calculated as a percentage of the original amount because that was the amount before the change.
    </p>
  <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Maria has been thinking about selling her car. The value went from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What is the absolute and relative change in the car's value?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we will subtract to calculate the absolute change:
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{Absolute Change} \amp= \text{Ending Amount} - \text{Starting Amount}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\$6800 - \$7400</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=-\$600</mrow>
          </md>
        The absolute change is a decrease of $600 in the car's value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can calculate the relative change:
        </p>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{Relative Change} \amp= \frac{\text{Absolute Change}}{\text{Starting Amount}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \frac{-\$600}{\$7400}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\approx -0.081</mrow>
          </md>
          The relative change in the price of the car was a decrease of about 8.1% of it's value.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice in the last example we either used the negative sign or the word decrease to show the direction of the change. We could say the car's value changed by -8.1% or decreased by 8.1%. We wouldn't use both at the same time because that would be a double negative. Let's look at another example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          After raises, Iryna's wage went from $22 to $25 per hour. Sundar's hourly wage went from $19 to $21.85. Calculate their absolute and relative raises. Who got a larger raise?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we will calculate the absolute raises:
        </p>
        <sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
            <stack>
              <p>
                Iryna:
              </p>
            <p>
              <m>\$25 - \$22 = \$3</m>
            </p>
            </stack>
            <stack>
            <p>
              Sundar:
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>\$21.85 - \$19 = \$2.85</m>
            </p>
            </stack>
          </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Iryna got a larger absolute raise of $3 per hour compared with $2.85 for Sundar. Now we will calculate the relative raises.
        </p>
          <sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
            <stack>
            <p>
              <m>\frac{\$3}{\$22} \approx 0.136 \text{ or } 13.6\%</m>
            </p>
            <p>
              Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay.
            </p>
            </stack>
            <stack>
            <p>
              <m>\frac{\$2.85}{\$19} = 0.15 \text{ or } 15\%</m>
            </p>
            <p>
              Sundar's raise was 15% of his pay.
            </p>
            </stack>
          </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Sundar had a relative raise of 15% of his pay and Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay. Iryna had the larger absolute raise but Sundar had the larger raise relative to their starting wages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that instead of subtracting first, we could have divided the new pay by the base pay. For Sundar's pay we get
          <m>\frac{\$21.85}{\$19} = 1.15 \text{ or } 115\%</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is another way to see that Sundar had a raise of 15%.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice in the last example that Sundar's new pay was 1.15 times his old pay or an increase of 15%. He is getting 100% of his original salary plus an additional 15%.
    </p>

  <subsection>
      <title>Doubling, Tripling, Etc.</title>
      <p>
        Now let's say the company that made $120,000 in profit the first year made $240,000 in profit in their second year. We can say their profit doubled or was two times the previous year. This is a 100% increase because they matched their original profit for 100%, and they also had an increase of 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to triple their first year's profit they would need to make $360,000 in profit. Be precise with your wording when describing percent changes because tripling their profit is an increase of 200%.
      </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Multiple Percent Changes</title>
    <p>
      We can also calculate values with multiple percent increases and decreases. We must be careful here because the base changes each time. For example, if a stock price drops by 60% in one week and increases by 75% the next week, this is not the same as an increase of 15%. The base for the drop is the original price and the base for the increase is the lower price. Let's look at this more closely in the next example.
    </p>
  
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        A stock valued at $100 dropped in value by 60% one week, then increased in value the next week by 75%. Is the value higher or lower than where it started? What is the ending value and what is the combined relative change?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          After one week, the value dropped by 60% so we have
          <md>
            <mrow>\$100 - \$100(0.60) \amp= \$100 - \$60</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \$40</mrow>
          </md>
          In the next week, the starting value of the stock is $40, so that is the new base. Computing the 75% increase we get
          <md>
            <mrow>\$40 + \$40(0.75) \amp= \$40 + \$30</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \$70</mrow>
          </md>
          In the end, the stock is $70, which is $30 lower, or 30% lower than it started.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you enjoyed the shorter method we showed before, it is really useful for multiple percent changes.
          <md>
            <mrow>\$100(1-0.60)(1+0.75) \amp= \$100(0.40)(1.75)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \$70</mrow>
          </md>
