    <title>Creating Graphs</title>
    <p>There are several tools available for creating graphs of functions. We will provide instructions for <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" visual="desmos.com">Desmos</url>, which is a free web-based graphing utility. Information about using Desmos with a screen reader and other accessibility tools is found on their <url href="https://www.desmos.com/accessibility" visual="desmos.com/accessibility">accessibility page</url>.</p>

    <title>How to Create and Edit a Graph</title>
    <p>The following general steps should be used when creating effective graphs:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Enter the equation, expression, or function in the expression list.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Adjust the bounds on the x-axis and y-axis as needed to ensure that the graph shows all features of the function(s) over a realistic time interval.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add descriptive labels for the axes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    Note that step 2 can also be achieved with a touchscreen or mouse and keyboard. On a touchscreen, use the pinch and spread gestures with your fingers touching the axes. Alternatively, hold down the shift key on the keyboard while clicking and dragging the mouse on the axes.
</p>

<example>
    <title>Graphing with Desmos</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The functions <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m> and <m>P_2(t)=100(1.02)^{t}</m> model the value <m>P</m> in dollars of two different investments after <m>t</m> years. Please do not be confused by the use of subscripts 1 and 2 on the function names; their purpose is simply to distinguish between the two functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a single graph showing <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m>. There are two intersection points: be sure that both are visible in the graph.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p> <em>Step 1: Enter the functions.</em> In the Desmos graphing calculator, we enter one equation into the expression line. Hitting enter or clicking in the space directly below the expression line brings up another line where we enter the other equation as seen below. </p>
                        <image source="images/graphing-first-step.png" width="75%"> <shortdescription>Screenshot from Desmos. Both equations are entered, but the graph shows only a portion of one line.</shortdescription></image>
    
        <p><em> Step 2: Adjust the bounds on the axes.</em> We click on the wrench icon to access the Graph Settings menu in Desmos. Then, through experimentation, we adjust the intervals for the x- and y-axes until the graph shows both functions and both of the points where they intersect. (This can also be done using pinch and spread gestures on a touchscreen or holding down the Shift key while clicking and dragging on an axis.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <em> Step 3: Add labels.</em> In the Graph Settings menu, we type labels in the boxes provided. The x-axis label is "Time (yrs)" and the y-axis label is "Value ($)".
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the graph in a document or submit in an assignment, we click on the Export button that looks like a box with a curved arrow pointing out of it. The "Export Image" option allows the graph to be downloaded as a picture file. The resulting graph is shown below.
        </p>
        <image source="images/graphing-example.png" width="50%">
            <shortdescription>Horizontal axis shows values between 0 and 200 and is labeled Time (yrs). Vertical axis shows values between 0 and 4000 and is labeled Value ($). There is a increasing linear function and an increasing exponential function. They intersect at (0,100) and near (180, 3800).</shortdescription>
        </image>
        <p>
            Depending on the intended purpose of the graph, it might also be helpful to include a caption or use words to tell the reader that the straight-line graph represents <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m> and the curved exponential graph represents <m>P_2(t)=100(1.02)^{t}</m>.

    <title>Using Graphs to Solve Problems</title>
    <p>
        Graphing technology can be used to evaluate functions and solve equations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Evaluate a Function:</em>  Once the function has been defined by entering it on an expression line, put your curson in a new expression line and enter your calcuation in function notation. For example, if you have defined <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m>, you can type <m>P_1(4)</m> and hit Enter to find that value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Solve Equations:</em>  Solutions to equations are represented graphically by intersection points. More precisely, if you are solving an equation of the form <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>, the solutions are the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of <m>y=f(x)</m> and <m>y=g(x)</m> intersect.
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Fish population</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The population of an invasive fish species in a pond follows the logistic growth function <m>P(t)=\frac{200}{1+25e^{-0.04t}}</m> where <m>P</m> is the number of fish in the pond at time <m>t</m> in months after a few of the fish were accidentally introduced into the ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the population after 10 months.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After how many months will the population reach 100 fish?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To find the population after 10 months, we need to evaluate <m>P(10)</m>. (We know that because 10 years is a time, which is a <m>t</m> value; we are replacing <m>t</m> with 10. In Desmos, we enter <m>P(t)=\frac{200}{1+25e^{-0.04t}}</m> on an expression line and hit Enter. On the next expression line, or any available expression line, we type <m>P(10)</m> and hit Enter. The value 11.2625288342 appears. Rounding to the nearest whole fish, we conclude that there were about 11 fish in the pond after 10 months.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To determine how many months it will take the population to reach 100 fish, we will solve the equation <m>P(t)=100</m>. (We know to do this because 100 is a number of fish, which is a <m>P</m> value, so we are replacing the output with 100. That is found by determining where the graphs of <m>y=P(t)</m> and <m>y=100</m> intersect. We already have the graph of <m>y=P(t)</m> displayed from the previous part of this example. On a new expression line, we input <m>y=100</m> and adjust the viewing rectangle in the graph until we can see where the two graphs intersect. Clicking on the intersection point brings up the coordinates of the point, <m>(80.4719.100)</m>. Recall that we are looking for the time, or <m>t</m> value, which is about <m>80.5</m> months.

        <title>Projectile Motion</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The function <m>h(t)=-16t^{2}+64t+5</m> models the height <m>h</m> in feet of a pumpkin at time <m>t</m> seconds after it is launched from a trebuchet. Use graphing technology to determine the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the initial height of the pumpkin.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Find the height of the pumpkin after <m>3</m> seconds.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            After how many seconds does the pumpkin reach its maximum height, and what is the maximum height?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After how many seconds does the pumpkin land on the ground, which is a height of <m>0</m> feet?
                        </p>
                    </li>

            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
               We begin by creating a graph of the function and the line <m>y=0</m>; then we adjust the viewing rectange to show the maximum height and the intercepts.

                Now we can use the graph to answer the questions.

                        <p>
                            The initial height of the pumpkin is <m>P(0)=5</m> feet above the ground.
                        </p>

                            After 3 seconds, the pumpkin is at a height of <m>P(3)=53</m> feet above the ground.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The highest point on the graph corresponds to its maximum. The coordinates of this point are <m>(2,69)</m>. The x-coordinate is the time, so we can say that the pumpkin reaches its maximum height after 2 seconds. The y-coordinate is the height, so we can say that the maximum height is 69 feet. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            The time when the pumpkin lands on the ground is the x-coordinate of one of the points where the graph intersects the line <m>y=0</m>, which is the x-axis. This is because the height of the ground is 0 feet. There are two such points, but we may disregard the point with a negative x-value since we are not going backward in time. Therefore, the time when it lands is <m>x=4.07666</m> seconds.

        <title>Home Value</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A home was purchased for $350,000 in 2012. If home values in the area have been increasing by 9% per year according to an exponential model, when will the home be worth $1,000,000?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                For simplicity, we will measure time <m>t</m> in years since 2012 and the value <m>P(t)</m> will be measured in thousands of dollars. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using an exponential model of the form <m>P(t)=P_0\left(1+r\right)^{t}</m> with <m>P_0=350</m> and <m>r=0.09</m>, we obtain the function <me>
                    P(t)=350\left(1.09\right)^{t}

            </p>
            <p>
                The time when the value reaches $1,000,000 is the solution to the equation <m>P(t)=1000</m>. To find this solution, we will graph <m>y=P(t)</m> and <m>y=1000</m>; then find where the graphs intersect.
