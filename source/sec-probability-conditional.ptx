    <introduction>
    
        <p>
            When we looked at categorical data in the previous chapter, it was related to a single variable, or characteristic of interest, such as favorite movie or car color. To illustrate the data, we made a frequency table and used it to create a pie chart or bar chart. But what if we want to illustrate the relationship between two categorical variables? To do this, we can use a contingency table.

        <title>Conditional Probability</title>
    
        <p>
            Another question we can answer using a contingency table is what percentage of dog owning households also own a cat? In this case the group that we are interested in isn't every household surveyed (the grand total), but just those households that own a dog.

        <p>
            We call this a <alert>conditional</alert> statement because we are only considering the households with a certain condition. If we focus on the column representing the households that own a dog, we see that there is a total of 95 households with a dog, and that 52 of those 95 households also have a cat. Therefore, <m>\frac{52}{95} \approx 0.547</m> or approximately 54.7% of the households with a dog also have a cat. Another way to phrase this conditional statement is, <q>What percent of households have a cat <alert>given</alert> they have a dog.</q> You will see the word given quite a bit in this chapter and that makes the denominator change. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If <m>C</m> is the event "owning a cat" and <m>D</m> is the event "owning a dog", then the probability that someone owns a cat given that you know they own a dog is written <m>P(C|D)=\frac{52}{95}.</m>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                In this situation, we already know that the card drawn is one of the 12 face cards. Of those, four are kings. Therefore, the probability is
                <me>
                    P(\text{king}|\text{face card})=\frac{4}{12}=\frac{1}{3}.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Find the probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card also is a heart.

                <p>
                    Find the probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card is not a heart.

                    <p>
                        A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards, thirteen of which are hearts. If the first card draws is a heart, then the total number of cards drops to 51 and the total number of hearts drops to twelve. Therefore,
                        <me>
                            P(\text{second card is a heart}|\text{first card is a heart})=\frac{12}{51}\approx23.5\%.

                <li>
                    <p>
                        If the first card is not a heart, then all thirteen hearts still remain in the deck. Therefore,
                        <me>
                            P(\text{second card is a heart}|{first card is not a heart})=\frac{13}{51}\approx 25.5\%

    <statement>

            Two dice are rolled. Find the probability that the second die shows a 5 given that the first die shows a 5.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            This is something of a trick question because the outcome of the first die is unrelated to the outcome of the second die. The probability that the second die shows a 5 is <m>P(5)=\frac{1}{6}</m> regardless of what the first die shows.

    <title>Independent and Dependent Events</title>
    <p>
        Two or more events are called <term>dependent</term> if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other(s). For example, the probability that a second card drawn from a deck (without replacement) is a heart <em>depends</em> on whether the first card drawn was a heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two or more events are called <term>independent</term> if the occurrence of one has not affect on the the probability of the other(s). For example, the probability that a second die rolled shows a 5 is <em>independent</em> of the result of the first die.

This cell has 57 voters, so we divide that by the total number of voters. This gives us or <m>\frac{57}{910} \approx 0.063</m> or approximately 6.3% of these voters identify as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option.

                        The <em>or</em> in this question is inclusive, so we need to determine the number of voters who identify as liberal, who are in favor of the leaving the country option, or both.

                <p>
                    In terms of the individual cells, the number of voters who have the specified characteristics is the sum <m>179+126+101+28+45+1=480</m>, which we can divide by the total number of voters surveyed to get the percent. So, we have <m>\frac{480}{910} \approx 0.527</m> or approximately 53% of the voters identify as liberal or are in favor of the leave the country option. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to calculate this is to add the total number who identify as liberal (175 voters) and the total number who are in favor of the leave the country option (350 voters), then subtract the double counted cell (45 voters) who are liberal and in favor of the leave the country option: <m>175+350-45=480</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        As we saw before, these are conditional statements. For the first part of this question, we want to focus just on those voters who identify as conservatives, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate that <m>\frac{57}{372} \approx 0.153</m> or approximately 15% of conservative voters are in favor of the citizenship option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the second part, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as moderate, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. Then we have <m>\frac{120}{363} \approx 0.33</m> or approximately 33% of moderate voters are in favor of the citizen option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as liberal, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate <m>\frac{101}{175} \approx 0.58</m> or approximately 58% of liberal voters are in favor of the citizenship option. Looking at these three percentages, it is clear that support of the citizenship option <alert>depends</alert> on political ideology. If support of the citizenship option were the same across political ideologies, then we would say that favoring the citizenship option and political ideology were <alert>independent</alert> of each other.

                        To find <m>P(\text{red or ticket})</m>, we need to add those who drive a red car and did not have a speeding ticket (just red), those who had a speeding ticket and do not drive a red car (just ticket) and those who drive a red car and had a speeding ticket (both), and divide by the total number of participants:

                        The probability <m>P(\text{speeding ticket}|\text{red car})</m> is a conditional probability as we have seen before since it is conditional on the given characteristic occurring. In this problem, the given characteristic is owning a red car, so we isolate our attention to just the row of 150 red car owners and see how many have had a speeding ticket in the last year. Looking at the table, we see that there were 15 red car owners who had a speeding ticket in the last year, so we calculate:

                        This question is also asking for a conditional probability, <m>P(\text{red car given speeding ticket})</m>, but it is phrased more like we would say it. In this case the given characteristic is that the person has received a speeding ticket, so we will isolate our attention to just the speeding ticket column. Among the 60 people who had a speeding ticket in the last year, we see that 15 also drove a red car. Now we can calculate the probability:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <md>
                        <mrow>P(\text{red car given speeding ticket})=\frac{15}{60} = 0.25\text{ or }25\%</mrow>
                        </md>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice that compared with part e, when we change the conditional characteristic, we change the denominator of the fraction.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In part b, we determined that there was a 9% chance of randomly selecting a participant who had received a speeding ticket in the last year. However, in part e we found that there was a 25% chance of receiving a ticket in the last year if the person had a red car. This seems to suggest that there is a higher likelihood of getting a speeding ticket if you own a red car. This means that getting a speeding ticket is <term>dependent</term> on whether the person drives a red car, since that increases the probability of getting a ticket. We cannot say, however, whether driving a red car makes you speed or whether people who tend to drive faster buy red cars.

            A fitness center coach kept track over the last year of whether members stretched before they exercised, and whether or not they sustained an injury. Among the 400 members, 322 stretched before they exercised, 327 did not sustain an injury, and 270 both stretched and did not sustain an injury.
