        <title>Conditional Probability</title>
    
        <p>
            Recall in the previous section we used a contingency table to determine the probability that a pet-owning household has a cat or a dog. We also may wonderwhat percentage of dog-owning households also own a cat? In this case the group that we are interested in isn't every household surveyed (the grand total), but just those households that own a dog.

        <p>
            We call this a <alert>conditional</alert> statement because we are only considering the households with a certain condition. If we focus on the column representing the households that own a dog, we see that there is a total of 95 households with a dog, and that 52 of those 95 households also have a cat. Therefore, <m>\frac{52}{95} \approx 0.547</m> or approximately 54.7% of the households with a dog also have a cat. Another way to phrase this conditional statement is, <q>What percent of households have a cat <alert>given</alert> they have a dog.</q> You will see the word given quite a bit in this chapter and that makes the denominator change. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If <m>C</m> is the event "owning a cat" and <m>D</m> is the event "owning a dog", then the probability that someone owns a cat given that you know they own a dog is written <m>P(C|D)=\frac{52}{95}\approx 57.7\%.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, we can find the probability that a cat-owning household also owns a dog. In this case, we restrict our attention to the row corresponding to cat owners and find <m>P(D|C)=\frac{52}{180}\approx 28.9\%.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            What does this tell us? According to the poll data, if you see someone with a dog, there is a 54.7% chance that they also have a cat at home. However, if you meet a cat owner, there is only a 28.9% chance that they also have a dog.

        <solution>
            <p>
                In this situation, we already know that the card drawn is one of the 12 face cards. Of those, four are kings. Therefore, the probability is
                <me>
                    P(\text{king}|\text{face card})=\frac{4}{12}=\frac{1}{3}.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Find the probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card also is a heart.

                    Find the probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card is not a heart.

                    <p>
                        A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards, thirteen of which are hearts. If the first card draws is a heart, then the total number of cards drops to 51 and the total number of hearts drops to twelve. Therefore,
                        <me>
                            P(\text{second card is a heart}|\text{first card is a heart})=\frac{12}{51}\approx23.5\%.

                        If the first card is not a heart, then all thirteen hearts still remain in the deck. Therefore,
                        <me>
                            P(\text{second card is a heart}|{first card is not a heart})=\frac{13}{51}\approx 25.5\%

            Two dice are rolled. Find the probability that the second die shows a 5 given that the first die shows a 5.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            This is something of a trick question because the outcome of the first die is unrelated to the outcome of the second die. The probability that the second die shows a 5 is <m>P(5)=\frac{1}{6}</m> regardless of what the first die shows.

        Two or more events are called <term>dependent</term> if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other(s). For example, the probability that a second card drawn from a deck (without replacement) is a heart <em>depends</em> on whether the first card drawn was a heart.

        Two or more events are called <term>independent</term> if the occurrence of one has not affect on the the probability of the other(s). For example, the probability that a second die rolled shows a 5 is <em>independent</em> of the result of the first die.

        <p>
           Let <m>R</m> be the event "driving a red car", and let <m>S</m> be the event "received a speeding ticket". We will calculate <m>P(T|R)</m> and <m>P(T)</m> and determine whether the difference is greater than the margin of error.
        <me>

        </p>
        <p>
            Since the two probabilities differ by 1% which is within the margin of error, we cannot conclude that driving a red car and getting a speeding ticket are dependent.

        <title>Probability of Sequential Events</title>
       <p>
        Consider the experiment of selecting two marbles from a jar without replacement. The jar initially contains two green marbles, which we will call G1 and G2, and two blue marbles, which we will call B1 and B2. Using methods from <xref ref="sec-probability-fundamentals"/>, we can find the probability that both marbles are blue as follows.
       </p> 
       <p>
        Using the notation that (B1,G2) represents drawing blue marble B1 followed by green marble G2, we write the sample space.
        <md>
            <mrow>
            S=\{\amp (B1,B2),(B1,G1),(B1,G2),(B2,B1),  
            </mrow>
            <mrow> 
                \amp (B2,G1),(B2,G2),(G1,B1),(G1,B2), 
            </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp (G1,G2),(G2,B1),(G2,B2),(G2,G1)\}</mrow>
        </md>
        
       </p>
       <p>
        There are twelve elements in the sample space. We are interested in the event that both marbles are blue, <m>E=\{(B1,B2),(B2,B1)\}.</m> Therefore the probability is
        <me>
            P(E)=\frac{2}{12}=\frac{1}{6}.
        </me>
        
       </p>
       <p>
        Isn't there a more efficient way to find this probability? Yes, there is!
       </p>
       <p>
        The probability that the first marble is blue is <m>P(\text{first blue})=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}</m> because two out of the four marbles are blue. Now, assuming that the first marble was blue, there will be three marbles left in the jar, only one of which is blue. The probability that the second marble also is blue is <m>P(\text{second blue}|\text{first blue})=\frac{1}{3}.</m>
       </p>
       <p>
        The probability that both marbles are blue is the product of these two probabilities!
        <md>
            <mrow>
            P(\text{first blue}\cap \text{second blue})= \amp P(\text{first blue})\cdot P(\text{second blue}|\text{first blue})
            </mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3}</mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp \frac{1}{6} </mrow>
        </md>
        
       </p>
       <p>
        The probability of two or more events in sequence is the the product of the probability that the first event occurs and the probability that the second event occurs given or assuming that the first event occurred.

            For any events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>:
            <me>
                P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B|A).

        </p>
        <p>
            If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <em>independent</em>, we can simplify to:
            <me>
                P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B).
            </me>

            For three or more events, we use additional factors as needed.

        We will investigate why this rule works later in the chapter.
       </p>
       <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Four cards are drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck <em>without replacement</em>. Find the probability that all four are hearts.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The solution is the product of <m>P(\text{first heart})</m>, <m>P(\text{second heart }|\text{ first heart})</m>, <m>P(\text{third heart }|\text{ first two hearts})</m>, and <m>P(\text{fourth heart }|\text{ first three hearts}).</m>
                <me>
                 P(\text{all four hearts})= \frac{13}{52} \cdot \frac{12}{51} \cdot \frac{11}{50} \cdot \frac{10}{49} \approx 0.26\%
                </me>
            </p>
        </solution>
       </example>
       <example>
           <statement>
            <p>
                Four cards are drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck <em>with replacement</em>. This means that each card is replaced in the deck before the next is drawn. Find the probability that all four are hearts.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The solution is the product of <m>P(\text{first heart})</m>, <m>P(\text{second heart }|\text{ first heart})</m>, <m>P(\text{third heart }|\text{ first two hearts})</m>, and <m>P(\text{fourth heart }|\text{ first three hearts}).</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in this situation, all four probabilities are the same because the cards are replaced. The events are independent!
                <me>
                 P(\text{all four hearts})= \frac{13}{52} \cdot \frac{13}{52} \cdot \frac{13}{52} \cdot \frac{13}{52} \approx 0.39\%

                Consider the experiment of flipping a coin five times.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the probability that all five flips result in heads.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the probability that at least one flip results in tails. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Each coin flip is an independent event with probability of heads <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Therefore, the probability that all five flips result in heads is
                            <me>
                                P(\text{all five heads})=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{32}
                            </me>
                            
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Instead of calculating the probability of getting at least one tails directly, which would be quite onerous, we make use of the fact that "at least one tails" is the <em>complement</em> of "all heads". We can find the answer by subtracting our previous answer from one.
                            <me>
                                P(\text{at least one tails})=1-P(\text{all heads})=1-\frac{1}{32}=\frac{31}{32}
                            </me>
                            On average, if we repeated this experiment, we can expect to see all five heads once out of every 32 times, and we can expect to see at least one tails the other 31 out of 32 times.
                        </p>

            A fitness center coach kept track over the last year of whether members stretched before they exercised, and whether or not they sustained an injury. Among the 400 members, 322 stretched before they exercised, 327 did not sustain an injury, and 270 both stretched and did not sustain an injury.

                        It apppears that sustaining an injury is dependent on whether the member stretches before exercising. The probability of sustaining an injury among members who did not stretch before exercising was significantly higher than the probability of sustaining an injury among members who stretched before exercising.
