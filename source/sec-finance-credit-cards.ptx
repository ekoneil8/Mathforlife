  <title>Credit Cards</title>
<introduction>
  <p>Credit cards are a common source of debt. The Federal Reserve Bank reported that in the second quarter of 2024, Americans 
    owed $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, which is an average of about $4,400 per adult. In this section, we will investigate 
    how credit cards work with the goal of empowering readers to make educated financial decisions about these accounts.</p>

      <title>What is a Credit Card?</title>
      <p>
        Credit cards are a form of revolving debt. With most loans, such as mortgages or car loans, the money is borrowed all at 
        once and paid back with interest over time. With credit cards, borrowers use the card to make purchases, and they pay back 
        some or all of the amount borrowed each month, and this cycle of borrowing and making payments continues until the account 
        is closed.

        <shortdescription>Three monthly payments are diagrammed, showing the monthly billing statement generated at the end of each monthly cycle and due 21-25 days into the subsequent cycle. Each bill includes the total spending from the current month, any remaining unpaid balance from the previous month, and a finance charge on the previous month.</shortdescription>

      <p>
        Credit card accounts are unique in that if the borrower pays the entire statement balance each month, there is no interest 
        charged on purchases made using the card.  Further, many cards offer rewards to the consumer in the form of cash back, 
        points or miles in rewards programs, or even reducing the balance of a home loan! On the other hand, the if the borrower is 
        unable to pay the entire statement balance each month, they begin to accrue finance charges, which are calculated using the 
        simple interest formula. The interest rates on credit card accounts tend to be significantly higher than those for other 
        types of loans, so borrowers can find themselves amassing a large amount of debt quite quickly.

  <title>Credit Card Agreements: Reading the Fine Print</title>
  <p>
    A credit card agreement describes the policies and rates which apply to the account. It should contain a table summarizing the interest rates and fees. An example is provided below.
