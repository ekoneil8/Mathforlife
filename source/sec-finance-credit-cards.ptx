      <title>What is a Credit Card?</title>
      <p>
        Credit cards are a form of revolving debt. With most loans, such as mortgages or car loans, the money is borrowed all at 
        once and paid back with interest over time. With credit cards, borrowers use the card to make purchases, and they pay back 
        some or all of the amount borrowed each month, and this cycle of borrowing and making payments continues until the account 
        is closed.

Beginning of second month: first monthly billing statement issued: all transactions from first month and annual fee if any. 3. Near the end of second month: first montly bill due; pay any amount between the minimum payment and full statement balance. 4. Beginning of third month: second monthly billing statement issued: all transactions applied during second month, unpaid balance carried over from first month, if any, and finance charge on first month's balance, if any. 5. Near the end of third month: second monthly payment due; pay any amount between the minimum payment and the full balance. 6. After end of third month: Third monthly billing statement issued: all transactions applied during second month, unpaid balance carried over from previous months, if any, and finance charge on second month's balance, if any.

        Credit card accounts are unique in that if the borrower pays the entire statement balance each month, there is no interest 
        charged on purchases made using the card.  Further, many cards offer rewards to the consumer in the form of cash back, 
        points or miles in rewards programs, or even reducing the balance of a home loan! On the other hand, the if the borrower is 
        unable to pay the entire statement balance each month, they begin to accrue finance charges, which are calculated using the 
        simple interest formula. The interest rates on credit card accounts tend to be significantly higher than those for other 
        types of loans, so borrowers can find themselves amassing a large amount of debt quite quickly.
