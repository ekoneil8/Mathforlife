  <title>Credit Cards</title>
<introduction>
  <p>Credit cards are a common source of debt. The Federal Reserve Bank reported that in the second quarter of 2024, Americans 
    owed $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, which is an average of about $4,400 per adult. In this section, we will investigate 
    how credit cards work with the goal of empowering readers to make educated financial decisions about these accounts.</p>

      <title>What is a Credit Card?</title>
      <p>
        A credit cards is a form of revolving debt. With most loans, such as mortgages or car loans, the money is borrowed all at 
        once and paid back with interest over time. With credit cards, borrowers use the card to make purchases, and they pay back 
        some or all of the amount borrowed each month, and this cycle of borrowing and making payments continues until the account 
        is closed.

        <shortdescription>Three monthly payments are diagrammed, showing the monthly billing statement generated at the end of each monthly cycle and due 21-25 days into the subsequent cycle.

      <p>
        Credit card accounts are unique in that if the borrower pays the entire statement balance each month, there is no interest 
        charged on purchases made using the card.  Further, many cards offer rewards to the consumer in the form of cash back, 
        points or miles in rewards programs, or even reducing the balance of a home loan! On the other hand, the if the borrower is 
        unable to pay the entire statement balance each month, they begin to accrue finance charges, which are calculated using the 
        simple interest formula. The interest rates on credit card accounts tend to be significantly higher than those for other 
        types of loans, so borrowers can find themselves amassing a large amount of debt quite quickly.

    <title>Credit Card Balances and Finance Charges</title>
    <p>
      The balance in an account typically means the amount of money currently held in that account, whether it is a debt or an investment. With credit cards, the amount owed changes frequently and fees are accrued over time but applied once. As such, there are several different types of balance:

    <title>Types of Balances</title>
    <p>
      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Statement Balance or New Balance:</term> the total amount shown on the billing statement. It is the sum of the ending balance and any finance charges or fees that are applied at the end of the billing cycle.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

      A <em>finance charge</em> is the interest charged on the amount owed. It is calculated as the simple interest on the balance on the account. However, there are several ways this can be done. Most credit card accounts use either the daily balance and apply finance charges daily or they use the average daily balance and apply finance charges monthly. Each credit card agreement will indicate which method is used.

          Suppose this credit card uses the average daily balance method and charges an annual interest rate of 19.9%. Find the ending balance, the average daily balance, the finance charge, and the total balance after the finance charge is applied. For calculating the finance charge, this account measures time in days.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the <em>ending balance</em>, starting with the previous balance, we add the charges and subtract the credits.
          <me>
            1234+314-1000-192+30+120=386
          </me>
          Therefore, the ending balance is $386.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the <em>average daily balance</em>, we first find the balance at the end of each day. Then we find the average of the daily balances. It can be helpful to write the balances in a calendar or grid.
        </p>
        <image source="images/credit-card-daily-bal-calendar.png">
          <shortdescription>Jan 23-26: $1234, Jan 27-29: $1548, Jan 30-Feb 3: $548, Feb 4-11: $356, Feb 12-13: $386, Feb 14-22: $506</shortdescription>
        </image>
        <p>
          Now we can find the average of the balances in each day of the cycle. We will use multiplication for the repeated addition, and we note that there are 31 days in the billing cycle.
          <me>
            \frac{1234\cdot4+1548\cdot3+548\cdot5+356\cdot7+385\cdot2+506\cdot9 }{31}\approx$649.55
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, a spreadsheet can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>finance charge</em> is 31 days simple interest on the average daily balance at 19.9%.
        </p>

    <title>Residual Interest Alert</title>
    <p>
    After a consumer fails to pay the entire statement balance on a credit card and a finance charge has been applied, many credit card accounts transition to accumulating interest charges on a daily basis. This type of finance charge is called <term>residual interest</term> or <term>trailing interest</term>. Some credit card accounts use this method exclusively to calculate finance charges.

  <title>Credit Card Agreements: Reading the Fine Print</title>

    A credit card agreement describes the policies and rates which apply to the account. It should contain a table summarizing the interest rates and fees. An example is provided below.
