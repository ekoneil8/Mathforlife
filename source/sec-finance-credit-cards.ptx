  <title>Credit Cards</title>
<introduction>
  <p>Credit cards are a common source of debt. The Federal Reserve Bank reported that in the second quarter of 2024, Americans 
    owed $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, which is an average of about $4,400 per adult. In this section, we will investigate 
    how credit cards work with the goal of empowering readers to make educated financial decisions about these accounts.</p>

      <title>What is a Credit Card?</title>
      <p>
        A credit cards is a form of revolving debt. With most loans, such as mortgages or car loans, the money is borrowed all at 
        once and paid back with interest over time. With credit cards, borrowers use the card to make purchases, and they pay back 
        some or all of the amount borrowed each month, and this cycle of borrowing and making payments continues until the account 
        is closed.

        <shortdescription>Three monthly payments are diagrammed, showing the monthly billing statement generated at the end of each monthly cycle and due 21-25 days into the subsequent cycle.

    </figure>
      <p>
        Credit card accounts are unique in that if the borrower pays the entire statement balance each month, there is no interest 
        charged on purchases made using the card.  Further, many cards offer rewards to the consumer in the form of cash back, 
        points or miles in rewards programs, or even reducing the balance of a home loan! On the other hand, the if the borrower is 
        unable to pay the entire statement balance each month, they begin to accrue finance charges, which are calculated using the 
        simple interest formula. The interest rates on credit card accounts tend to be significantly higher than those for other 
        types of loans, so borrowers can find themselves amassing a large amount of debt quite quickly.

    <title>Credit Card Balances and Finance Charges</title>
    <p>
      The balance in an account typically means the amount of money currently held in that account, whether it is a debt or an investment. With credit cards, the amount owed changes frequently and fees are accrued over time but applied once. As such, there are several different types of balance:

    <p>
      A <em>finance charge</em> is the interest charged on the amount owed. It is calculated as the simple interest on the balance on the account. However, there are several ways this can be done. Most credit card accounts use either the average daily balance and apply finance charges monthly or they use the the daily balance and apply finance charges daily. Each credit card agreement will indicate which method is used.
     </p>
     <example>
      <title>Finance Charge Calculation using Average Daily Balance</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the average daily balance on a credit card account is $5,224.27. Calculalate the finance charge for a 30-day month if the annual percentage rate (APR) is 11.5% and the charge is calculated using each method.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Based on the number of days in the billing period.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Based on one month as one twelfth of a year.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The APR is the annual interest rate, <m>r</m>, and the finance charge is the interest, <m>I</m>, on the balance, <m>P</m>, for the given amount of time.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the finance charge is based on the number of days in the billing period, then the amount of time in years is <m>t=\frac{30}{365}</m>. Therefore, the finance charge is calculated as follows.
            <md>
              <mrow>I \amp=Prt </mrow>
              <mrow>I \amp=(5224.27)(0.115)\left(\frac{30}{365}\right) </mrow>
              <mrow>I \amp \approx \$49.38 </mrow>
            </md>
            The finance charge is rounded to the nearest cent.
            </p>
            <p>
              An alternative approach is to convert the annual percentage rate to a daily rate <m>\frac{0.115}{365}</m>; then multiply the balance by the daily rate times the number of days. This results in the equivalent calculation
            <me>
              I=(5224.27)\left(\frac{0.115}{365}\right)(31)\approx \$49.38.
            </me>
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the finance charge is based on just one month, each month is considered one twelfth of a year regardless of how many days it contains. Therefore, we will use <m>t=\frac{1}{12}</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>I \amp=Prt</mrow>
              <mrow>I \amp= (5224.27)(0.115)\left(\frac{1}{12}) </mrow>
              <mrow>I \amp\approx \$50.07 </mrow>
            </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              An alternative approach is to convert the annual percentage rate to a monthly rate <m>\frac{0.115}{12}</m>; then multiply the balance by the monthly rate times the number of months, which is one. This results in the equivalent calculation
            <me>I=(5224.27)\left(\frac{0.115}{12}\right)\approx \$50.07</me>

          Suppose this credit card uses the average daily balance method and charges an annual interest rate of 19.6%. We will find the ending balance, the average daily balance, the finance charge, and the total balance after the finance charge is applied. For calculating the finance charge, this account measures time in days.
        </p>
      </statement>
        <solution>
        <p>
          To find the <em>ending balance</em>, starting with the previous balance, we add the charges and subtract the credits.
          <me>
            1234+314-1000-192+30+120=386
          </me>
          Therefore, the ending balance is $386.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the <em>average daily balance</em>, we first find the balance at the end of each day. Then we find the average of the daily balances. It can be helpful to write the balances in a calendar or grid.
        </p>
        <image source="images/credit-card-daily-bal-calendar.png">
          <shortdescription>Jan 23-26: $1234, Jan 27-29: $1548, Jan 30-Feb 3: $548, Feb 4-11: $356, Feb 12-13: $386, Feb 14-22: $506</shortdescription>
        </image>
        <p>
          Now we can find the average of the balances in each day of the cycle. We will use multiplication for the repeated addition, and we note that there are 31 days in the billing cycle.
          <me>
            \frac{1234\cdot4+1548\cdot3+548\cdot5+356\cdot7+385\cdot2+506\cdot9 }{31}\approx$649.55
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, a spreadsheet can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>finance charge</em> is 31 days simple interest on the average daily balance at 19.6%.
          <md>
            <mrow>I \amp= Prt </mrow>
            <mrow> I\amp=649.55(0.196)\left(\frac{31}{365}\right) </mrow>
            <mrow>I \amp\approx 10.81 </mrow>
          </md>
          Therefore, the finance charge will be $10.98.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the annual percentage rate (APR) of 19.6% can be converted to a daily rate of <m>\frac{19.6\%}{365}</m> and multiplied by the number of days. The resulting finance charge calculation results in the same value: 
          <md>
            <mrow> I\amp =P\left(\text{Daily Rate}\right)\left(\text{Number of days}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>I \amp= 649.55\left(\frac{0.196}{365}\right)\left(31\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>I \amp\approx 10.81 </mrow>
          </md>
  
          
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the total amount owed, we add the ending balance and the finance charge to obtain <m>386+10.81=$396.81</m>.
        </p>
