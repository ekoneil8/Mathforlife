  <title>Credit Cards</title>
<introduction>
  <p>Credit cards are a common source of debt. The Federal Reserve Bank reported that in the second quarter of 2024, Americans 
    owed $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, which is an average of about $4,400 per adult. In this section, we will investigate 
    how credit cards work with the goal of empowering readers to make educated financial decisions about these accounts.</p>

      <title>What is a Credit Card?</title>
      <p>
        Credit cards are a form of revolving debt. With most loans, such as mortgages or car loans, the money is borrowed all at 
        once and paid back with interest over time. With credit cards, borrowers use the card to make purchases, and they pay back 
        some or all of the amount borrowed each month, and this cycle of borrowing and making payments continues until the account 
        is closed.

        <shortdescription>Three monthly payments are diagrammed, showing the monthly billing statement generated at the end of each monthly cycle and due 21-25 days into the subsequent cycle. Each bill includes the total spending from the current month, any remaining unpaid balance from the previous month, and a finance charge on the previous month.</shortdescription>

      <p>
        Credit card accounts are unique in that if the borrower pays the entire statement balance each month, there is no interest 
        charged on purchases made using the card.  Further, many cards offer rewards to the consumer in the form of cash back, 
        points or miles in rewards programs, or even reducing the balance of a home loan! On the other hand, the if the borrower is 
        unable to pay the entire statement balance each month, they begin to accrue finance charges, which are calculated using the 
        simple interest formula. The interest rates on credit card accounts tend to be significantly higher than those for other 
        types of loans, so borrowers can find themselves amassing a large amount of debt quite quickly.

    <title>Credit Card Balances</title>
    <p>
      The balance in an account typically means the amount of money currently held in that account, whether it is a debt or an investment. With credit cards, the amount owed changes frequently and fees are accrued over time but applied once. As such, there are several different types of balance:
    </p>
  <assemblage xml:id="assemblage-balance-types">
    <title>Types of Balances</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Previous Balance:</term> the amount of debt carried over from the previous month.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Ending Balance:</term> the amount owed at the end of a billing cycle before finance charges or other fees have been applied.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Statement Balance or New Balance:</term> the total amount shown on the billing statement. It is the sum of the ending balance and any finance charges or fees that are applied at the end of the billing cycle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Current Balance:</term> the total balance at a given time. The current balance incorporates any unpaid debt carried over from the previous billing cycle and any activity (purchases, payments, etc.) that have been posted to the account.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Payoff Balance:</term> the total amount a consumer would have to pay to close out the account. It is the sum of the current balance and any prorated finance charges that have accumulated but not yet been applied. (A prorated finance charge is also called residual interest.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Average Daily Balance:</term> the average of the current balances on each day of a billing cycle.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
         The term <term>balance</term> typically refers to either the statement balance or the current balance, depending on the context.
    </p>
   <p>
    Most credit card accounts use the average daily balance to calculate finance charges, although some use the ending balance.

          Find the ending balance and find the average daily balance.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the ending balance, starting with the previous balance, we add the charges and subtract the credits.
          <me>
            1234+314-1000-192+30+120=386
          </me>
          Therefore, the ending balance is $386.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the average daily balance, we first find the balance at the end of each day. Then we find the average of the daily balances. It can be helpful to write the balances in a calendar.

  <title>Finance Charges</title>
<p>
  Finance charges typically include the interest on either the ending balance or the average daily balance for the month. They can be calculated using the simple interest formula, <m>I=Prt</m>, where <m>I</m> is the interest or finance charge, <m>r</m> is the annual interest rate (APR), and <m>t</m> is the length of time in years for the billing cycle.
</p>
<p>
  Some credit card accounts consider the each month to be <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year, and so they use <m>t=\frac{1}{12}</m> for finance charge calculations. However, it is more common to use the exact number of days. For example, if there are 31 days in a particular billing cycle, then they will use <m>t=\frac{31}{365}</m> for that month.

    <title>Residual Interest Alert</title>
    <p>
    After a consumer fails to pay the entire statement balance on a credit card and a finance charge has been applied, many credit card accounts transition to accumulating interest charges on a daily basis. This type of finance charge is called <term>residual interest</term> or <term>trailing interest</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of each day, interest is calculated on the current balance using the <m>I=Prt</m> formula with <m>t=\frac{1}{365}</m> (or <m>t=\frac{1}{366}</m> on a leap year) and applied to the account.
    </p>

  <title>Credit Card Agreements: Reading the Fine Print</title>
  <p>
    A credit card agreement describes the policies and rates which apply to the account. It should contain a table summarizing the interest rates and fees. An example is provided below.

<p>
  The For consumers who routinely pay the whole statement balance each month, the APR is of little importance.
