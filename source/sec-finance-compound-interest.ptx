  <title>Compound Interest</title>

  <p> </p>

  <subsection>
	<title>Introduction to Compound Interest</title>
	<p>
		In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called <alert>compounding</alert>. We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?
	</p>
	<p>
		The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) â€“ the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn <m>\frac{0.03}{12}=0.0025</m> per month.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first month,
	</p>

	<p>
		<md>
		<mrow>P\amp= \$1000</mrow>
		<mrow>r\amp=0.0025</mrow>
		<mrow>I\amp= \$1000 (0.0025)= \$2.50</mrow>
		<mrow>A\amp= \$1000 + \$2.50 = \$1002.50</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the second month,
	</p>
	<p>
		<md>
			<mrow>P\amp=\$1002.50</mrow>
			<mrow>I\amp=\$1002.50(0.0025)=\$2.51 \text{ (rounded)}</mrow>
			<mrow>A\amp=\$1002.50+\$2.51=\$1005.01</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.

    <title>About Rounding</title>
    <p>
    When completing the table above, we rounded each interest amount to the nearest cent and used the rounded value in subsequent calculations. This
    is how banking institutions calculate and apply or charge interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next in this section, we will develop and use a formula to calculate future value in one step without making a table. Using this formula 
      bypasses the intermediate rounding steps and can result in values that may be slightly different from the correct value. Don't worry: 
      the results typically are off by a few cents at most, so using the formula provides a highly efficient way to make long-term predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since banks use mathematical formulas to calculate loan payments, these small differences affect us in "real life", too! If you or
       someone you know is paying off a loan, the bank may have adjusted the payment size by a few cents to account for rounding.
    </p>
    
  </note>
	<p>
		To find an equation to calculate future balances more efficiently, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:
	</p>
	<p>
		Initial Amount: <m>P=\$1000</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>1^{\text{st}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>2^{\text{nd}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025(\$1000))=1.0025^{2}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>3^{\text{rd}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025^{2}(\$1000))=1.0025^{3}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>4^{\text{th}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025^{3}(\$1000))=1.0025^{4}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Observing a pattern, we could conclude
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>m^{\text{th}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025^{m}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
  <p>
    If we wanted to calculate the balance after 15 years, we observe that 15 years is equal to <m>15\cdot12=180</m> months. This results in
    <me>
      1.0025^{180}(\$1000)\approx\$1567.43
    </me>
    
  </p>
	<p>
		Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. This approach is generalized to the formula that follows.
	</p>
  
	<assemblage>
		<title>Compound Interest</title>
		<p>
			<me>A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \text{ or } P=\frac{A}{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}}</me>
		</p>
		<p>
		<dl width="narrow">
			<li>
				<title>A</title>
				<p>
					is the future value balance in the account after <m>t</m> years
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title>P</title>
				<p>

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title>t</title>
				<p>
					is the number of years
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>
	</p>
  <p>
    Note that the exponent <m>nt</m> is equal to the total number of periods.
  </p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		If the compounding is done annually (once a year), <m>n = 1</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the compounding is done quarterly, <m>n = 4</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the compounding is done monthly, <m>n = 12</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the compounding is done weekly, <m>n = 52</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the compounding is done daily, <m>n = 365</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account <alert><insert>once</insert></alert> and let it sit there earning interest.

  <title>Applications of the Compound Interest Formula</title>
<example>
  <title>Finding a Future Value</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
			A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% APR, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			<m>P = \$3\,000</m>, the initial deposit
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>r = 0.06</m>, 6% annual rate
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>n = 12</m>, 12 months in 1 year
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>t = 20</m>, since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years
		</p>
    <p>
      <me>
        A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}=3000\left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{12\cdot 20}\approx$9930.61
      </me>
      
    </p>
<p>
  Therefore, we will end up with approximately $9,930.61 after 20 years.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
		<p>
			The calculation in the example above also can be done using the future value formula on a spreadsheet. The format is as follows:
			<cd>=FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)</cd>
      where the rate per period is <m>\frac{r}{n}</m>, the number of periods is <m>nt</m>, and the present value is the principal <m>P</m>. In this section, we only deal with one-time investments, so the payment amount will be $0.
		</p>
		<p>
      In the exercise, we would type
			<cd>=FV(0.06/12, 12*20, 0, 3000)</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			and get a result of $9,930.61, rounded to the nearest cent.
		</p>

<title>Comparing Simple and Compound Interest</title>
	<p>
		Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.

<title>Finding the Principal, or Present Value</title>
	<p>
		When we know the amount of money we want to have in the future, we can use the formula that is solved for <em>P</em>. It requires a little algebra to divide both sides of the formula by the quantity that was multiplied by <em>P</em>. There is also a spreadsheet formula which we will introduce now, and then do an example using both methods.
	</p>

<title>The Present Value Spreadsheet Formula</title>

		<p>
			<m>A = \$40{,}000</m>, the amount we have in 18 years

	<title>Continuously Compounded Interest</title>

	<title>Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage</title>
	<p>
		In the previous example we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $4,849.11. Now to figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			Continued: To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\$4{,}849.11-\$4{,}000=\$849.11</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			The spreadsheet calculation is
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=4849.11-4000</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			which gives a result of $849.11. You would earn $849.11 in interest.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find the percentage that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount.
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\frac{\$849.11}{4{,}849.11}\approx0.1751\text{ or } 17.5\%</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			The spreadsheet calculation is the same:
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=849.11/4849.11</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			which is 0.1751 or 17.5%. This tells us that after 7 years, 17.5% of the account was earned as interest.

	<title>Effective Rate</title>
	<p>
		If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called <c>=EFFECT</c> which will allow us to compare accounts. This is also sometimes called the annual percentage yield, or APY.
