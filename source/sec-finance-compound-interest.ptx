    <title>About Rounding</title>
    <p>
    When completing the table above, we rounded each interest amount to the nearest cent and used the rounded value in subsequent calculations. This
    is how banking institutions calculate and apply or charge interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we will develop and use a formula to calculate future value in one step without making a table. Using this formula 
      bypasses the intermediate rounding steps and can result in values that may be slightly different from the correct value. Don't worry: 
      the results typically are off by a few cents at most, so using the formula provides a highly efficient way to make long-term predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since banks use mathematical formulas to calculate loan payments, these small differences affect us in "real life", too! If you or
       someone you know is paying off a loan, the bank may have adjusted the payment size by a few cents to account for rounding.
