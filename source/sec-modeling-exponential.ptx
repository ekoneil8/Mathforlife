  <title>Exponential Growth</title>

  <p> The next growth model we will examine is exponential growth. Linear growth occurs when
    a population increases by the same <em>amount</em> in each unit of time. Exponential growth happens when an initial
    population increases by the same <em>percentage or factor</em> in each unit of time.
  </p>
  <p> For example, consider a town of 1,000 people that is experiencing a population boom due to an abundance of jobs and affordable housing. 
    The population grows exponentially by 20% per year.  After one year, there will be <m>1000+0.20\cdot 1000=1200</m> people. The next year, the population will grow by 20%
    of 1,200 people, so there will be <m>1200+0.20\cdot 1200=1440</m> people. The year after that,
    there will be <m>1440+0.20 \cdot 1440=1728</m> people.
    
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's compare this population that start with 1,000 people and grows by 20% per year, which is exponential growth, with a population that
      starts with 1,000 people and grows by 200 people per year, which is linear growth.
