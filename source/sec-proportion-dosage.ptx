    <title>Calculating Dosages</title>
    <p>
    In calculating dosages, we will use the approach of multiplying by a conversion factor, or a "fancy 1".
    </p>
         <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The provider ordered 8,000 units of heparin. The vial is labeled 10,000 units/ml. What volume will you administer?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We need to convert 8,000 units into mililiters to determine the volume of medication to be administered to the patient. Since <m>10\,000\text{ units}=1\text{ ml}</m>, we have two conversion factors to choose from:
                <me>
                    \frac{10000\text{ units}}{1\text{ ml}}
                </me>
                or
                <me>
                    \frac{1\text{ ml}}{10000\text{ units}}.
                </me>
                
                Starting with <m>\frac{8\,000\text{ units}}{1}</m>, we multiply by the conversion factor that has "units" in the denominator to ensure that the "units" divide out.
                <me>
                    \frac{8000\cancel{\text{ units}}}{1}\cdot\frac{1\text{ ml}}{10000\cancel{\text{ units}}}=0.8\text{ ml}
                </me>
                Therefore, 0.8 ml of heparin should be administered to the patient.
            </p>
        </solution>

        Many prescriptions use latin abbreviations to indicate how often the medication should be administered. Some of the more common abbreviations are listed below.

        <me>
            1\text{ kilogram (kg)}\approx2.2\text{ pounds (lb)}
        </me>
        <me>

        Note: in the international system of units, micrograms are denoted as <m>\mu\text{g}</m>. To avoid potentially disastrous results that might arise from confusing <m>\mu\text{g}</m>> with mg, the medical community uses the abbreviation mcg for micrograms.

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The provider orders a maintenance dose of oral aminophylline, 3 mg/kg q6h.  The client weighs 110 lbs.  How many mg should the nurse administer to the client in a 24-hour period? 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            First, we will find the client's weight in kg:
            <me>
                \frac{110\cancel{\text{ lbs}}}{1}\cdot \frac{1\text{ kg}}{2.2\cancel{\text{ lb}}}=50\text{ kg}
            </me>
            </p>
        <p>            
           Next, we determine the amount of aminophylline administered in each dose:
           <me>
            \frac{3\text{ mg}}{1\cancel{\text{ kg}}}\cdot\frac{50\cancel{\text{ kg}}}{1}=150\text{ mg}
           </me>
        </p>
        <p>Since the dose is given every 6 hours, there will be <m>\frac{24}{6}=4</m> doses in each 24-hour period. This amounts to <m>4\cdot150=600\text{ mg}</m> each day.
        </p>
    </solution>
</example>
<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The physician ordered Norpace, 0.6 grams by mouth daily divided in four doses. 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Norpace is available in 150 mg capsules. How many capsules are needed in each dose?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The safety guidelines for Norpace state that the safe effective dose is 6-15 mg/kg/day. The patient weighs 99 lbs. Is the prescribed dose safe?
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        First, we convert 0.6 grams to miligrams:
                        <me>\frac{0.6\cancel{\text{ g}}}{1}\cdot\frac{1000\text{ mg}}{1\cancel{\text{ g}}}=600\text{ mg}.</me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We divide to determine the size of each dose: <m>600\div 4=150\text{ mg}</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since each capsule contains 150 mg, we should administer 1 capsule for each dose.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To determine if this dose is within safety guidelines, we must first convert 99 pounds to kilograms:
                        <me>
                          \frac{99\cancel{\text{ lb}}}{1}\cdot\frac{1\text{ kg}}{2.2\cancel{\text{ lb}}}=45\text{ kg}
                        </me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the previous part, we know that the daily dose is 600 mg. We divide to determine how many miligrams per kilogram this works out to be administered each day:
                        <m>
                            600\div 45 \approx 13.3\text{ mg/kg/day}
                        </m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 13.3 is between 6 and 15, we can confirm that this is a safe dose.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

<p>
    Some intravenously-administered medications are given as an <term>infusion</term>, meaning the IV line is controlled to administer a set number of drops per minute. It is important to administer infusions at the correct rate for the given medication and patient. 
</p>
<p>
    IV tubing administration sets come in various sizes, and the size is measured by the drip factor, also called the drop factor. For example, if a tubing set has a drip factor of 12 gtts/mL, then there are 12 drops in each milliliter. 
</p>
<p>
    While the size of each drop is fixed, the nurse can set how many drops of fluid are released each minute. A typical infusion dosage calculation will involve converting mL/min to gtts/min as follows.
</p>
<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            A medication has been prepared in an IV bag. The patient needs 100 milliliters to be infused over 30 minutes. If the tubing drop factor is 20 gtts/mL, how many gtts/min should be administered? Round to the nearest whole number.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            The fluid must be infused at a rate of 100 mL per 30 min, or <m>\frac{100}{30}</m> mL/min.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use the drop factor to convert to gtts/min:
            <me>
                \frac{100\cancel{\text{ mL}}}{30\text{ min}}\cdot \frac{20\text{ gtts}}{1 \cancel{\text{ mL}}}\approx 67 \text{ gtts/min}
            </me>
             The IV should be set to administer 67 gtts/min.
