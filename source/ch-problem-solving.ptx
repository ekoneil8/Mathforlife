  <title>Problem Solving</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        The goal of mathematics education is to develop problem-solving skills. However, most students in mathematics courses 
        spend the majority of their time working through practice exercises. What is the difference?    
    </p>
    <p>
        When working on a <term>problem</term>, you probably don't know at first how to approach solving it. You don't know what mathematical 
        tools might be applied in finding a solution. Part of solving a problem is understanding what is being asked, and figuring out 
        what a solution should look like. Solving a problem often involves false starts, making mistakes, and lots of scratch paper!
         The best way to get better at solving problems is to solve problems! You will find challenge problems at the end of some sections
         in this book. Please think of them as puzzles to work out rather than hurdles to overcome. 
    </p>
    <p>
		When working an <term>exercise</term>, you are practicing a skill.  You may have seen a teacher demonstrate a technique, or you may 
		have read a worked example in the book. You then practice on very similar assignments, with the goal of mastering 
		that skill. Mastering skills is like adding tools to your toolbox for solving problems. Sometimes, even with an example to follow, 
    you might encounter something that is called an exercise but presents a problem for you. Please give yourself permission to struggle, experiment, 
    and make mistakes. Then troubleshoot your own thinking. It is through such exploration and reflection that we all learn best!

    This chapter covers applications of several mathematical tools used in solving problems: equations, percents, and proportional reasoning. It concludes with an overview of problem-solving
    strategies.
