  <title>Problem Solving</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        The goal of mathematics education is to develop problem-solving skills. However, most students in mathematics courses 
        spend the majority of their time working through practice exercises. What is the difference?

        When working on a <term>problem</term>, you probably don't know at first how to approach solving it. You don't know what mathematical 
        tools might be applied in finding a solution. Part of solving a problem is understanding what is being asked, and figuring out 
        what a solution should look like. Solving a problem often involves false starts, making mistakes, and lots of scratch paper!
         The best way to get better at solving problems is to solve problems!

		When working an <term>exercise</term>, you are practicing a skill.  You may have seen a teacher demonstrate a technique, or you may 
		have read a worked example in the book. You then practice on very similar assignments, with the goal of mastering 
		that skill. Mastering skills is like adding tools to your toolbox for solving problems.

    This chapter demonstrates tools for working with percents and proportional reasoning and provides a general framework for an approach 
    to solving new problems. It provides
