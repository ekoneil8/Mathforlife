    We will start by defining some important terminology.

  <assemblage xml:id="assemblage-probability-terminology">
    <title>Terminology</title>
    <p>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Experiment</title>
          <p>
            An <term>experiment</term> is a repeatable procedure or test being done. Common examples are flipping a coin, rolling a pair of dice, drawing a playing card from a deck, or taking a COVID test.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Outcome</title>
          <p>
            An <term>outcome</term> is one possible result of an experiment. When drawing a playing card from a deck, one possible outcome is drawing the Queen of Spades. Another outcome is drawing the Two of Diamonds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Event</title>
          <p>
            An <term>event</term> is a particular outcome or set of outcomes. When rolling a pair of dice, one event is rolling "doubles", meaning that the same value is shown on both dice. (There are six different outcomes that make up this event.) Another event could be rolling a total of two.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Sample Space</title>
          <p>
            The <term>sample space</term> of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. When flipping a coin, the sample space consists of the two possible outcomes: Heads and Tails. We would write that as <m>S=\lbrace H,T \rbrace</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Probability</title>
          <p>
            The <term>probability</term> of an event is the likelihood that it will occur, usually expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. When flipping a coin, the probability of flipping heads is 50%.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
  <p>
    Consider the experiment of flipping a coin three times. We can denote, for example, the outcome of getting heads on the first flip, tails on the second flip, and tails on the third flip as <m>HTT</m>. Using this notation, the sample space can be written as follows:
  <me>
    S=\lbrace HHH{,}\, HHT{,}\, HTH{,}\, THH{,}\,HTT{,}\,THT{,}\,TTH{,}\,TTT\rbrace.
  </me>
  
  </p>
  <p>
    The event <m>E</m> of rolling at least two tails is <m>E=\lbrace HTT{,}\,THT{,}\,TTH{,}\,TTT\rbrace</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are four outcomes in which we get at least two tails out of the total of eight possible outcomes. Assuming it is a fair coin, meaning that all of the outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of the event <m>E</m>, which we write using function notation <m>P(E)</m> is:
    <me>
      P(E)=\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}.
    </me>
  </p>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the experiment: rolling a single standard six-sided die. (Die the singular of dice, so we can have one die or two or more dice.)
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the sample space, and how many outcomes are in the sample space?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What outcomes are in the event "rolling a three", and how many outcomes are in that event?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the probability of the event "rolling a prime number"?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The sample space is <me>S=\lbrace1{,}2{,}3{,}4{,}5{,}6\rbrace.</me>
            There are six outcomes in the sample space.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The event "rolling a three" is <me>E=\lbrace3\rbrace.</me>
            There is just one outcome in event <m>E</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The probability of rolling a three is
            <me>
              P(E)=\frac{1}{6}.
            </me>
            
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>
<p>
  To summarize, when all outcomes are equally likely, probability can be calculated as the number of ways what you are looking for occurs divided by the total number of things that can occur. A more formal definition follows.
</p>
<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-basic-probability">
  <title>Basic Probability</title>
  <p>
    If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability that event <m>E</m> occurs can be calculated as follows.
    <me>
      P(E)=\frac{\text{Number of outcomes corresponding to E}}{\text{Number of outcomes in the sample space}}
    </me>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    If an event is impossible, its probability is zero, and if an event is guaranteed, its probability is one or 100%. All other events have probabilities between zero and one:
    <me>
      0\le P(E) \le 1.
    </me>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    If you obtain a probability that is negative or greater than one, check your work<mdash/>there is a mistake somewhere.
  </p>
</assemblage>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let's say you have a bag with 40 truffles, 28 dark chocolate and 14 milk chocolate. If you pick a truffle at random, what is the probability that it will be dark chocolate?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Because we are picking a cherry  at random, we may assume that all outcomes (truffles) are equally likely, so we may use the basic probability formula. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't necessary to write sets for the sample space and the event because we already know how many items are in each, although writing the sets would not be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability of picking a dark chocolate truffle is
      <me>
        P(\text{dark chocolate})=\frac{\text{number of dark chocolate truffles}}{\text{total number of truffles}}=\frac{28}{40}
      </me>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      We can simplify to <m>\frac{7}{10}</m>. It would also be correct to express the probability as 0.7 or 70%.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>
<p>
 While probability theory has far-reaching applications in such fields as medicine, business, politics, and science, we will focus mostly on applications in games and gambling because less background knowledge is required to understand them. In particular, we will take many examples from games involving cards and dice.

  <title>Cards</title>
  <p>
    A standard American deck of playing cards consists of four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). Spades and clubs are black; hearts and diamonds are red. 
    </p>
    <p>Each suit contains 13 cards, each of a different rank: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          An Ace (A),which may be considered a low card, a high card, or both, depending on the game,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One each of cards numbered two through ten,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Jack (J),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Queen (Q), and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A King (K).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    Jacks, queens, and kings are considered <term>face cards</term>, and jacks, queens, kings, and aces are considered <term>picture cards</term>.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a total of 52 cards in the <em>standard</em> deck.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some games make use of two extra cards, called <term>jokers</term>, which may be considered <term>wild cards</term>.
   </p>
</assemblage>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Find the probability of getting an ace when drawing a single card from a standard 52-card deck.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      There is one ace in each of the four suits, so there are four aces in the deck out of the 52 total cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace is 
      <me>
        P(Ace)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}
      </me>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Find the probability of getting a black face card when drawing a single card from a standard deck.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      There are three face cards of each suit, and two of the suits are black. So, there are six black face cards, and the probability of drawing one of them is
    <me>
      P(\text{black face card})=\frac{6}{52}=\frac{3}{26}

    or approximately 11.54%.

    Many board games use two dice, each with six sides. Each side has a different number of dots: one through six.

  <p>
    The sample space for the 36 possible outcomes of rolling two dice is shown in the grid below. In each ordered pair, the first component represents the number of dots shown on the first die and the second component represents the number of dots shown on the second die.

    <p>
      When rolling two dice, if both show the same number it is called "doubles". What is the probability of rolling doubles?

  <solution>
    <p>
      There are six ways to roll doubles, <m>(1,1)</m> through <m>(6,6)</m>, out of the total of 36 possible outcomes. The probability is

    <p>
      What is the probability of getting a sum greater than eight when rolling two dice?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      There are four ways to obtain a sum of nine: <m>(6{,}3)</m>, <m>(5{,}4)</m>, <m>(4{,}5)</m>, and <m>(3{,}6)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three ways to obtain a sum of ten: <m>(6{,}4)</m>, <m>(5{,}5)</m>, and <m>(4{,}6)</m>.

    <p>
      There are two ways to obtain a sum of eleven: <m>(6{,}5)</m> and <m>(5{,}6)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one way to obtain a sum of twelve, which is the greatest possible sum: <m>(6{,}6)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Did you notice that entries with the same sum are aligned along diagonals of the sample space grid?)
    </p>
    <p>
      All together, there are 10 ways to obtain a sum greater than eight. Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum greater than eight is
      <me>
        P(\text{sum}\gt 8)=\frac{10}{36}=\frac{5}{18}

      or about 27.78%.

  <title>Probability of "And" and "Or" Events</title>
  <p>
    In mathematics, we use the words "and" and "or" in a very particular way.
  </p>
<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-probability-and-event">
  <title>"And"</title>
  <p>
    
    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two events. Then the event "<m>A</m> and <m>B</m>" is written <m>A\cap B</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the <em>intersection</em> (or overlap) of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, meaning both must be true.
  </p>
  
</assemblage>
<p>
  For example when rolling a single die, suppose <m>A=\lbrace2{,}3{,}5 \rbrace</m> is the event of rolling a prime number and <m>B=\lbrace 1{,}3{,}5 \rbrace</m> is the event of rolling an odd. Then 
  <me>A\cap B = \lbrace 3{,}5 \rbrace</me>
  is the event of rolling a number that is both prime and odd.
   </p>
<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-probability-or-event">
  <title>Or</title>
    <p>
     Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two events. Then the event "<m>A</m> or <m>B</m>" is written <m>A\cup B</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the <em>union</em> (or compilation) of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, meaning either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> or both must be true.
    </p>
</assemblage>
<p>
 If <m>A=\lbrace2{,}3{,}5 \rbrace</m> is the event of rolling a prime number and <m>B=\lbrace 1{,}3{,}5 \rbrace</m> is the event of rolling an odd, then 
  <me>A\cup B = \lbrace 1{,} 2 {,} 3{,}5 \rbrace</me>
  is the event of rolling a number that is either prime or odd (or both).      
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the experiment of drawing a single card from a standard deck, event <m>A</m> is "drawing a seven" and event <m>B</m> is "drawing a heart". How many elements are in the events <m>A \cap B</m> and <m>A \cup B</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Event <m>A\ cap B</m> consists of the sevens that are also hearts. There is only one seven of hearts, so there is one element in <m>A\capB</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event <m>A \cup B</m> consists of all the sevens and all the hearts. There are four sevens and 13 hearts, but we need to be careful not to count the seven of hearts twice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can say that there are four sevens, which includes the seven of hearts, and 12 additional hearts for a total of 16 elements in event <m> \cup B</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
<p>
  To find the total number of cards that are sevens or hearts, we added the number of sevens plus the number of hearts that are not sevens. Another way to think about this is adding the number of sevens plus the number of hearts and subtracting the intersection which is one card: the seven of hearts. That would give us 
  <me>
    4+13-1=16
  </me>
  cards. In general, the number of outcomes in event <m>A \cup B</m> is equal to the number of outcomes in <m>A</m> plus the number of outcomes in <m>B</m> minus the number of outcomes in <m>A \cap B</m>.
</p>
<p>
  we can generalize this approach to write a formula for the probability of an "or" event.
</p>
<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-probability-or">
  <title>Probability of A or B</title>
  <p>
    We have two equivalent methods to calculate the probability of an "or" event:

    <p>
      An outreach program for STEM majors a college is open to female students and first-generation students, which are students who are the first in their families to go to college. If 53% of the students at the college are female, 38% of the students are first-generation, and 17% are female first-generation students, what percentage of students are eligible for the program?
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> be the event that a student is female and let <m>B</m> be the event that a student is a first-generation student.

    <p>
      We are given that <m>P(A)=0.53</m>, <m>P(B)=0.38</m>, and <m>P(A \cap B)=0.17</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for the percentage of students who are female or first-generation, or <m>P(A \cup B)</m>, which we can find using the formula. 
      <md>
        <mrow>P(A\cup B) \amp=P(A)+P(B)-P( A\cap B) </mrow>
        <mrow>P(A \cup B) \amp=0.53+0.38-0.17 </mrow>
        <mrow>P(A \cup B) \amp=0.74 </mrow>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-complementary-events">
  <title>Complementary Events</title>
  <p>
    In the previous example, we found that 74% of students at a particular college are eligible for an outreach program. We could quickly determine the percentage of students who are not eligible by subtracting from 100% to find that 36% are not eligible.
  </p>
  <p>
  The two events, "being eligible for the program" and "not being eligible for the program", are <term>complementary</term>, meaning that together they <em>complete</em> the full list or full <em>complement</em> of possible outcomes. For two events to be complementary, it is also necessary that they cannot occur at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will see situations later in this chapter where it is significantly easier to calculate the probability that something <em>doesn't</em> happen than the probability that it does. We will use the strategy of first finding the probability that the event doesn't happen and then subtracting from one or 100%.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the probability of getting a sum of less than 11 when rolling two dice.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Looking at the table in <xref ref="assemblage-dice"/>, we see that there are three ways to obtain a sum of 11 or higher, which is the complement of the event we are interested in. This means that there must be <m>36-3=33</m> ways to obtain a sum less than 11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore
