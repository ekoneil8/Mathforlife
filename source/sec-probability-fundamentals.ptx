    The probability of a specified event is the chance or likelihood that it will occur.  There are several ways of viewing probability.  One would be experimental in nature, where we repeatedly conduct an experiment.  Suppose we flipped a coin over and over and over again and it came up heads about half of the time; we would expect that in the future whenever we flipped the coin it would turn up heads about half of the time.  When a weather reporter says “there is a 10% chance of rain tomorrow,” she is basing that on prior evidence; that out of all days with similar weather patterns, it has rained on 1 out of 10 of those days.

    We will start by defining some important terminology.

      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Experiment</title>
          <p>
            An <term>experiment</term> is a repeatable procedure or test being done. Common examples are flipping a coin, rolling a pair of dice, drawing a playing card from a deck, or taking a COVID test.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Outcome</title>
          <p>
            An <term>outcome</term> is one possible result of an experiment. When drawing a playing card from a deck, one possible outcome is drawing the Queen of Spades. Another outcome is drawing the Two of Diamonds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Event</title>
          <p>
            An <term>event</term> is a particular outcome or set of outcomes. When rolling a pair of dice, one event is rolling "doubles", meaning that the same value is shown on both dice. (There are six different outcomes that make up this event.) Another event could be rolling a total of two.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Sample Space</title>
          <p>
            The <term>sample space</term> of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. When flipping a coin, the sample space consists of the two possible outcomes: Heads and Tails. We would write that as <m>S=\lbrace H,T \rbrace</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Probability</title>
          <p>
            The <term>probability</term> of an event is the likelihood that it will occur, usually expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. When flipping a coin, the probability of flipping heads is 50%.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
  <p>
    Consider the experiment of flipping a coin three times. We can denote, for example, the outcome of getting heads on the first flip, tails on the second flip, and tails on the third flip as <m>HTT</m>. Using this notation, the sample space can be written as follows:
  <me>
    S=\lbrace HHH{,}\, HHT{,}\, HTH{,}\, THH{,}\,HTT{,}\,THT{,}\,TTH{,}\,TTT\rbrace.
  </me>
  
  </p>
  <p>
    The event <m>E</m> of rolling at least two tails is <m>E=\lbrace HTT{,}\,THT{,}\,TTH{,}\,TTT\rbrace</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are four outcomes in which we get at least two tails out of the total of eight possible outcomes. Assuming it is a fair coin, meaning that all of the outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of the event <m>E</m>, which we write using function notation <m>P(E)</m> is:
    <me>
      P(E)=\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}.
    </me>
  </p>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the experiment: rolling a single standard six-sided die.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the sample space, and how many outcomes are in the sample space?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What outcomes are in the event "rolling a three", and how many outcomes are in that event?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the probability of the event "rolling a prime number"?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The sample space is <me>S=\lbrace1{,}2{,}3{,}4{,}5{,}6\rbrace.</me>
            There are six outcomes in the sample space.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The event "rolling a three" is <me>E=\lbrace3\rbrace.</me>
            There is just one outcome in event <m>E</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The probability of rolling a three is
            <me>
              P(E)=\frac{1}{6}.
            </me>
            
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>
<p>
  To summarize, when all outcomes are equally likely, probability can be calculated as the number of ways what you are looking for occurs divided by the total number of things that can occur. A more formal definition follows.
</p>
<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-basic-probability">
  <title>Basic Probability</title>
  <p>
    If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability that event <m>E</m> occurs can be calculated as follows.
    <me>
      P(E)=\frac{\text{Number of outcomes corresponding to E}}{Number of outcomes in the Sample Space}
    </me>
    
  </p>
</assemblage>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let's say you have a bag with 20 cherries, 14 sweet and 6 sour. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability that it will be sweet?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Because we are picking a cherry  at random, we may assume that all outcomes (cherries) are equally likely, so we may use the basic probability formula. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't necessary to write sets for the sample space and the event because we already know how many items are in each, although writing the sets would not be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability of picking a sweet cherry is
      <me>
        P(sweet)=\frac{\text{number of sweet cherries}}{\text{total number of cherries}}=\frac{14}{20}
      </me>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      We can simplify to <m>\frac{7}{10}</m>. It would also be correct to express the probability as 0.7 or 70%.
    </p>
  </solution>

 While probability theory has far-reaching applications in medicine, politics, and science, we will focus mostly on applications in games and gambling because less background knowledge is required to understand them. Information about standard 52-card decks and 5-sided dice follows.
</p>
<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-Cards">
  <title>Cards</title>
  <p>
    A standard deck of 52 playing cards consists of four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). Spades and clubs are black while hearts and diamonds are red. 
    </p>
    <p>Each suit contains 13 cards, each of a different rank: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          An Ace (A),which may be considered a low card, a high card, or both, depending on the game,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One each of cards numbered 2 through 10,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Jack (J),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Queen (Q), and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A King (K).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    Jacks, queens, and kings are considered <term>face cards</term>, and jacks, queens, kings, and aces are considered <term>picture cards</term>.
   </p>

  <title>Dice</title>
  
  <p>
    Many games use two dice, each with six sides. Each side has a different number of dots: one through six.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sample space for rolling two dice is shown in the grid below. In each ordered pair, the first component represents the number of dots shown on the first die and the second component represents the number of dots shown on the second die.

    Note that the singular of dice is <em>die</em>. So, we can have one die as opposed to two or more dice.
