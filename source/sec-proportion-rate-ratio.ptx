  <p>
    When cooking rice, the amounts of water and rice should be <em>proportional</em>, meaning that the ratio of the amount of water to the amount of rice should be the same, regardless of how much rice you are cooking. For microwaved rice, that ratio is three parts water to two parts rice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proportional reasoning is the practice of using mathematics to solve problems involving ratios and rates, such as determining the amount of water to add to <m>1 \frac{1}{2}</m> cups of rice. (You should use <m>2 \frac{1}{4}</m> cups of water.) 
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section, we will explore applications of proportional reasoning in such practical situations as cooking, travel, and home improvement.

    <title>Unit Rates</title>
    <p>
      Imagine that you are at the grocery store comparing the prices for two brands of pasta sauce. One costs $3.50 for one jar while the other is on sale at $11.50 for three jars.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to approach the problem is to compare the price per jar or <term>unit rate</term> of each brand. (In this particular scenario, we might use the term unit price to be more specific.) The unit rate for the first brand is $3.50 per jar. To find the unit rate for the second jar, we divide:
    <me>
      11.50\div 3\approx 3.83.
    </me>
    Since the unit price of the first brand is lower, we find that it is the better deal.

          The 2020 Census <fn>US Census Bureau, "QuickFacts: Kitsap County, Washington, <url href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kitsapcountywashington/PST045223" visual="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kitsapcountywashington/PST045223">www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kitsapcountywashington/PST045223</url></fn> reports that Kitsap County, Washington, has a population of 275,612 people and covers 395.1 square miles of land. Find the population density as a unit rate of people per square mile.

      <statement>
        <p>
          One brand of eggnog costs $6.99 for 59 fluid ounces, and another brand costs $3.99 for one quart. (There are 32 ounces in one quart.) Calculate the unit prices to determine the better deal.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For each brand, will divide the price by the volume in ounces to determine the unit price in dollars per ounce.
        </p>
        <p>
          First brand:
          <me>
            6.99\div 59\approx 0.1185.
          </me>
          The unit price is $0.1185 per ounce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second brand:
          <me>
            3.99\div 32\approx 0.1247.
          </me>
          The unit price is $0.1247 per ounce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the first brand is a better deal. (Larger volume containers tend to be cheaper, but not always!)
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          At one store, bananas are $0.63 per pound. At another store, bananas cost $0.19 each. At what weight per banana is the first store's price better, and at what weight is the second store's price better?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We are given two unit prices, but the units are different.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are looking for the weight per banana, so let's call that <m>w</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the first store, one banana will cost <m>0.63w</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that the second store charges $0.19 for one banana. Therefore, the first store's price is better when <me>0.63w \lt 0.19.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.63 and rounding to four decimal places, we obtain
            <me>
              w \lt 0.3016.
            </me>
            
         
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the first store's price is better if a banana weighs less than 0.3016 pounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the second store's price is better if a banana weighs more than 0.3016 pounds.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A rockclimber burns 16 calories per minute. How long will it take them to burn 200 calories?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <title>Using a proportion</title>
               
        <p>
        We first express the unit rate of 16 calories per minute as a fraction: <m>\frac{16 \text{ calories}}{1\text{ minute}}</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The rate of calories to minutes when they burn 200 calories can be expressed as a fraction using the variable <m>x</m> to represent the number of minutes: <m>\frac{200\text{ calories}}{x\text{ minutes}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two rates must be equal, so we set up and solve an equation. (This is a special type of equation called a proportion.)
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{16}{1} \amp=\frac{200}{x} </mrow>
            <mrow> 16x\amp=1\cdot200 </mrow>
            <mrow> x\amp=\frac{200}{16} </mrow>
            <mrow> x\amp=12.5 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it will take the climber 12.5 minutes to burn 200 calories.
        </p>
      </solution>
      <solution>
        <title>Using "Rate <times/> Time = Amount"</title>
             
        <p>
          The "burn rate" in calories per minute times the number of minutes will equal the total number of calories burned. Using the variable <m>x</m> to represent the number of minutes, we can set up and solve an equation.
        <md>
          <mrow> 16x\amp=200 </mrow>
          <mrow> x\amp=\frac{200}{16} </mrow>
            <mrow> x\amp=12.5 </mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it will take the climber 12.5 minutes to burn 200 calories.

    <title>Unit Conversions</title>
  <p>
      To convert units, we will use the strategy of multiplying by a "fancy one". The technical term for this approach is <term>dimensional analysis</term>. For example, since one pint is equal to two cups, both of these fractions are equal to one:
      <me>\frac{1\text{ pint}}{2\text{ cups}}=\frac{2\text{ cups}}{1\text{ pint}}=1</me>
     The fractions <m>\frac{1\text{ pint}}{2\text{ cups}}</m> and <m>\frac{2\text{ cups}}{1\text{ pint}}</m> are called <term>conversion factors</term> because they are factors (multipliers) used to convert between units.
     </p>
     <p>
      To convert between pints and cups, we can multiply by the conversion factor that will result in the original units being "divided out", leaving an equivalent value in terms of the new units. For example, suppose we needed to convert <m>5.25</m> cups to pints.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        we start by writing <m>5.25</m> cups as a fraction: <m>\frac{5.25 \text{ cups}}{1}</m>. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Because we would like to "divide out" the cups units from the numerator, we multiply by the conversion factor that has cups in the denominator, <m>\frac{1 \text{ pint}}{2 \text{ cups}}</m>, as follows:
      
      <me>
        \frac{5.25 \cancel{\text{ cups}}}{1}\cdot \frac {1 \text{ pint}}{2 \cancel{\text { cups}}}=\frac{5.25 \text{ pints}}{2}=2.625 \text{ pints}
      </me>
      
      Because we have just multiplied by one, the value stays equivalent in the new units. 
    </p>
        <p>
      The reader may point out correctly that converting between pints and cups is done more quicky by just multiplying and dividing by two. However, when multiple conversions must be done in sequence and there are units in both the numerator and denominator of an expression, conversion factors simplify the process. Following are some more involved examples. A list of common unit conversions is found at the end of this section in <xref ref="subsec-proportion-common-conversions"/>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Convert 20 miles per hour to feet per minute.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <title>Step-by-step approach</title>
        
        
        <p>
          There are 5280 feet in one mile and there are 60 minutes in one hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start by writing 20 miles per hour as a fraction:  <m>\frac{20\text{ mi}}{1\text{ hr}}</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To divide out the miles in the numerator, we will use a conversion factor with miles in the denominator; the numerator will be 5280 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{20\cancel{\text{ mi}}}{1 \text{ hr}}\cdot\frac{5280\text{ ft}}{1\cancel{\text{ mi}}}=\frac{105\,600\text{ft}}{1\text{hr}}
          </me>
          
        </p>
        <p>
           To divide out the hour in the denominator, we will use a conversion factor with hours in the numerator; the denominator will be 60 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{105\,600\text{ ft}}{1\cancel{ \text{ hr}}}\cdot\frac{1\cancel{\text{ hr}}}{60\text{ min}}=1760\text{ ft/min}
          </me>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, a vehicle moving 20 miles per hour travels 1,760 feet each minute.
        </p>
        </solution>
        <solution>
        <title>All-at-once approach</title>
        
                
        <p>
          Note that we can complete both conversions in one step as follows:
          <me>
            \frac{20\cancel{\text{ mi}}}{1\cancel{\text{ hr}}}\cdot\frac{5280\text{ ft}}{1\cancel{\text{ mi}}}\cdot\frac{1\cancel{\text{ hr}}}{60\text{ min}}=1760\text{ ft/min}
          </me>
          </p>
          <p>
          Therefore, a vehicle moving 20 miles per hour travels 1,760 feet each minute.

          They will need <m>3\cdot 4 =12</m> tablespoons of sugar.

        <p>
          We make use of the conversions that there are two tablespoons in an ounce and eight ounces in a cup.
          <me>
            \frac{12\cancel{\text{ tablespoons}}}{1}\cdot \frac{1 \cancel{\text{ ounce}}}{2 \cancel{\text{ tablespoons}}}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ cup}}{8 \cancel{ \text{ ounces}}}=\frac{3}{4}\text{ cups}
          </me>

  <title>Proportional Reasoning with Rates and Ratios</title>
    <p>
      There are many real-life problems in which proportional reasoning can be applied. Some examples from various contexts follow.
    </p>
      <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          You are making many pizzas for a large party. Your favorite recipe makes 20 ounces of dough, which is the right amount for two 12-inch diameter pizzas. You plan to make six 16-inch pizzas for the party. By what factor should you multiply or scale the recipe, and how many ounces of dough will that make?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
       <p>
        Assume that the thickness of a 16-inch pizza is the same as the thickness of a 12-inch pizza. You can compare the total area of pizza made from one recipe with the total area of pizza you plan to make for the party. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The formula for the area of a circle of radius <m>r</m> is <m>A=\pi r^{2}</m>. Recall that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter, so the original recipe makes two 6-inch radius pizzas and you want to make six 8-inch radius pizzas. Those areas are as follows:
        </p>
         <p>
            <em>Original Recipe:</em> Two pies of radius 6 inches
          </p>
          <p>
            <me>
              A=\pi (6)^{2}\cdot2=72 \pi \text{ square inches}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For Party:</em> Six pies of radius 8 inches
            <me>
              A=\pi (8)^{2}\cdot 6=384 \pi \text{ square inches}
            </me>
            
          </p>
        <p>
          The ratio of the area of pizza needed for the party to the area of pizza made by one recipe is <m>\frac{384\pi}{72\pi}=\frac{16}{3}\approx 5.33</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          When we make the dough, we will multiply the amount of each ingredient by <m>\frac{16}{3}</m>, which is the factor you should use to scale up the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resulting amount of dough should be <m>20\cdot\frac{16}{3}\approx106.67</m> ounces. For context, that is 6.67 pounds of dough. You will need a very large bowl!
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered how the speedometer on a car works? A car with 15.8-inch radius tires will move <m>2\pi \cdot 15.8=31.6 \pi</m> inches with each revolution. If the wheels are spinning 620 revolutions per minute, how fast is the car moving in miles per hour?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Our goal is to convert 620 revolutions per minute (rpm) to miles per hour. To do this, we will start with the expression <m>\frac{620 \text{ revolutions}}{1 \text { minute}}</m> and apply the following conversions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Convert revolutions to inches using the fact that each revolution moves the car <m>31.6\pi</m> inches.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Convert inches to feet and then feet to miles. There are 12 inches in one foot, and there are 5280 feet in one mile.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Convert minutes to hours.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{620 \text{ rev}}{1 \text { min}} \cdot \frac {31.6\pi \text {in}}{1 \text{rev}} \cdot \frac{1 \text { ft}}{12 \text { in}}\cdot \frac{1 \text{mi}}{5280 \text{ ft}} \cdot \frac{60 \text{ min}}{1 \text{ hr}}\approx 58 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{hr}}
          </me>
          
          Note that all of the units divide away exept the miles in the numerator and the hours in the denominator. Therefore, the car is moving 58 miles per hour.
          </p>
          <p>The above conversions can be done in any order, as long as we are careful about which units are in the numerator and which are in the denominator.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Comment:</em> Most modern cars have electric sensors that measure the rotational speed (rpm) of the wheels and send that information to the car's computer. The computer converts the rotational speed to linear speed in miles per hour. Because the calculation uses the tire size, if a car has the wrong sized tires, its speedometer will display an incorrect speed.

          <me>
            2(16\cdot9)+2(14\cdot9)=540 \text{ square feet.}
          </me>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we will find the areas of the windows and door. Note that the units are converted from inches to feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows:
          <md>
            <mrow> \text{Area}\amp=\text{Width}\cdot\text{Height} </mrow>
            <mrow>A \amp=\left( \frac{30 \text{ in}}{1}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12\text{ in}}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{80 \text{ in}}{1}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12\text{ in}} \right) </mrow>
            <mrow>A \amp= 13 </mrow>
          </md>
          The area of each window is 13 square feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Door:
          <md>
            <mrow> \text{Area}\amp=\text{Width}\cdot\text{Height} </mrow>
            <mrow>A \amp=\left( \frac{36 \text{ in}}{1}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12\text{ in}}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{52 \text{ in}}{1}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12\text{ in}} \right) </mrow>
            <mrow>A \amp \approx 16.67 </mrow>
          </md>
          The area of the door is about 16.67 square feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we subtract to find the resulting area that will be painted:
          <me>
            540-2(13)-16.67=497.33
          </me>
          The homeowner has about 497.33 square feet of wall space that need to be painted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since each can covers about 350 square feet, the homeowner can expect to use <m>497.33\div350\approx1.42</m> cans.
        </p>
        <p>
          They should purchase two cans of paint.

        The conversion between kilograms, which is a mass, and pounds, which is a weight, is valid for locations on the surface of the Earth. If you were to go to Mars, your mass (how big you are) would remain the same but your weight (how much force you exert on a scale due to gravity) would be reduced due to the weaker gravitational pull.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we live on the surface of the Earth, it is generally safe to convert between kilograms and pounds without worrying about the physics of mass and weight.
