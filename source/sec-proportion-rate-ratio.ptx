  <p>
    When cooking rice, the amounts of water and rice should be <em>proportional</em>, meaning that the ratio of the amount of water to the amount of rice should be the same, regardless of how much rice you are cooking. For microwaved rice, that ratio is 3 parts water to 2 parts rice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proportional reasoning is the practice of using mathematics to solve problems involving ratios and rates, such as determining the amount of water to add to <m>1 \frac{1}{2}</m> cups of rice. (You should use <m>2 \frac{1}{4}</m> cups of water.) 
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section, we will explore applications of proportional reasoning in such practical situations as cooking, travel, dosage calculations, and home improvement.

    <title>Unit Conversions</title>
  <p>
      To convert units, we will use the strategy of multiplying by a "fancy 1". The technical term for this approach is <term>dimensional analysis</term>. For example, since 1 pint is equal to 2 cups, both of these fractions are equal to 1:
      <me>\frac{1\text{ pint}}{2\text{ cups}}=\frac{2\text{ cups}}{1\text{ pint}}=1</me>
     The fractions <m>\frac{1\text{ pint}}{2\text{ cups}}</m> and <m>\frac{2\text{ cups}}{1\text{ pint}}</m> are called <term>conversion factors</term> because they are factors (multipliers) used to convert between units.
     </p>
     <p>
      To convert between pints and cups, we can multiply by the conversion factor that will result in the original units being "divided out", leaving an equivalent value in terms of the new units. For example, suppose we needed to convert <m>5.25</m> cups to pints.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        we start by writing <m>5.25</m> cups as a fraction: <m>\frac{5.25 \text{ cups}}{1}</m>. Because we would like to "divide out" the cups units from the numerator, we multiply by the conversion factor with the cups in the denominator, <m>\frac{1 \text{ pint}}{2 \text{ cups}}</m>, as follows:
      
      <me>
        \frac{5.25 \cancel{\text{ cups}}}{1}\cdot \frac {1 \text{ pint}}{2 \cancel{\text { cups}}}=\frac{5.25 \text{ pints}}{2}=2.625 \text{ pints}
      </me>
      
      Because we have just multiplied by 1, the value stays equivalent in the new units. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may point out correctly that converting between pints and cups is done more quicky by just multiplying and dividing by 2. However, when multiple conversions must be done in sequence and there are units in both the numerator and denominator of an expression, conversion factors simplify the process. Following are some more involved examples. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Convert 20 miles per hour to feet per minute.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are 5280 feet in 1 mile and there are 60 minutes in 1 hour. (For your reference, a list of unit conversions can be found at the end of this section.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We start by writing 20 miles per hour as a fraction:  <m>\frac{20\text{ mi}}{1\text{ hr}}</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To divide out the miles in the numerator, we will use a conversion factor with miles in the denominator; the numerator will be 5280 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{20\cancel{\text{ mi}}}{1\text{ hr}}\cdot\frac{5280\text{ ft}}{1\cancel{\text{ mi}}}=\frac{105\,600\text{ft}}{1\text{hr}}
          </me>
          
        </p>
        <p>
           To divide out the hour in the denominator, we will use a conversion factor with hours in the numerator; the denominator will be 60 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{105\,600\text{ ft}}{1\cancel{\text{ hr}}}\cdot\frac{1\cancel{text{ hr}}}{60\text{ min}}=1760\text{ ft/min}
          </me>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, a vehicle moving 20 miles per hour travels 1,760 feet each minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we could have completed both conversions in one step as follows:
          <me>
            \frac{20\cancel{\text{ mi}}}{1\cancel{\text{ hr}}}\cdot\frac{5280\text{ ft}}{1\cancel{\text{ mi}}}\cdot\frac{1\cancel{text{ hr}}}{60\text{ min}}=1760\text{ ft/min}
          </me>
          
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
     <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered how the speedometer on a car works? A car with 15.8-inch radius tires will move <m>2\pi \cdot 15.8=31.6 \pi</m> inches with each revolution. If the wheels are spinning 620 revolutions per minute, how fast is the car moving in miles per hour?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Our goal is to convert 620 revolutions per minute (rpm) to miles per hour. To do this, we will start with the expression <m>\frac{620 \text{ revolutions}}{1 \text { minute}}</m> and apply the following conversions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Convert revolutions to inches using the fact that each revolution moves the car <m>31.6\pi</m> inches.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Convert inches to feet and then feet to miles. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and there are 5280 feet in 1 mile.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Convert minutes to hours.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{620 \text{ rev}}{1 \text { min}} \cdot \frac {31.6\pi \text {in}}{1 \text{rev}} \cdot \frac{1 \text { ft}}{12 \text { in}}\cdot \frac{1 \text{mi}}{5280 \text{ ft}} \cdot \frac{60 \text{ min}}{1 \text{ hr}}\approx 58 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{hr}}
          </me>
          
          Note that all of the units divide away exept the miles in the numerator and the hours in the denominator. Therefore, the car is moving 58 miles per hour.
          </p>
          <p>The above conversions can be done in any order, as long as we are careful about which units are in the numerator and which are in the denominator.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Comment:</em> Most modern cars have electric sensors that measure the rotational speed (rpm) of the wheels and send that information to the car's computer. The computer converts the rotational speed to linear speed in miles per hour. Because the calculation uses the tire size, if a car has the wrong sized tires, its speedometer will display an incorrect speed.

  <title>Solving Problems Involving Rates and Ratios</title>
    <p>
      There are many real-life problems in which proportional reasoning can be applied. Some examples from various contexts follow.
    </p>
    
   

  
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          You are making many pizzas for a large party. Your favorite recipe makes 20 ounces of dough, which is the right amount for two 12-inch diameter pizzas. You plan to make six 16-inch pizzas for the party. By what factor should you multiply or scale the recipe, and how many ounces of dough will that make?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
       <p>
        Assume that the thickness of a 16-inch pizza is the same as the thickness of a 12-inch pizza. You can compare the total area of pizza made from one recipe with the total area of pizza you plan to make for the party. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The formula for the area of a circle of radius <m>r</m> is <m>A=\pi r^{2}</m>. Recall that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter, so the original recipe makes two 6-inch radius pizzas and you want to make six 8-inch radius pizzas. Those areas are as follows:
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
          <stack>
          <p>
            Original Recipe: Two pies of radius 6 inches
          </p>
          <p>
            <me>
              A=\pi (6)^{2}\cdot2=72 \pi \text{ square inches}
            </me>
          </p>
          </stack>
          <stack>
          <p>
            For Party: Six pies of radius 8 inches
            <me>
              A=\pi (8)^{2}\cdot 6=384 \pi \text{ square inches}
            </me>
            
          </p>
          </stack>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          The ratio of the area of pizza needed for the party to the area of pizza made by one recipe is <m>\frac{384\pi}{72\pi}=\frac{16}{3}\approx 5.33</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          When we make the dough, we will multiply the amount of each ingredient by <m>\frac{16}{3}</m>, which is the factor you should use to scale up the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resulting amount of dough should be <m>20\cdot\frac{16}{3}\approx106.67</m> ounces. For context, that is 6.67 pounds of dough. You will need a very large bowl!
