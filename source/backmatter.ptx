    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation, if needed, using the distributive property and/or combining like terms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add or subtract terms from both sides of the equation until only one term has a variable attached, and that term is isolated on one side of the equation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multiply or divide both sides of the equation by the same number to solve for the variable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Check that the solution is correct.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</assemblage>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Solve <m>2x-15=7</m>
      </p>
    </statement>

        <mrow> x\amp=11 </mrow>
      </md>      
      </p>
      <p>
        To check that the solution is correct, we can substitute <m>x=11</m> into the original equation and ensure that it results in a true statement:
        <md>
          <mrow> 2x-15\amp=7 </mrow>
          <mrow> 2(11)-15\amp=7 </mrow>
          <mrow> 22-15\amp=7 </mrow>
          <mrow>7 \amp=7 </mrow>
        </md>
        Since 7=7 is true, we know that the solution <m>x=11</m> is correct. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We also could have checked the solution using graphing technology by verifying that 11 is the x-coordinate of the intersection point of the graphs of <m>y=2x-15</m> and <m>y=7</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Simplify:
        <md>
          <mrow> 17(t-2)+15\amp =11t-10</mrow>
          <mrow> 17t-34+15\amp =11t-10</mrow>
          <mrow> 17t-19\amp=11t-10 </mrow>
        </md>
       
        Subtract <m>11t</m> from both sides and add <m>19</m> to both sides to get the variable term isolated on the left side of the equation:
        <md>
          <mrow> 17t-11t-19+19\amp=11t-11t-10+19 </mrow>
          <mrow> 6t\amp=9 </mrow>
        </md>
        Divide by 6 to solve:

          <mrow> t\amp =\frac{3}{2}</mrow>

        We can express the answer as <m>t=\frac{3}{2}</m>, <m>t=1 \frac{1}{2}</m>, or <m>t=1.5</m>.

    <title>Creating Graphs</title>
    <p>There are several tools available for creating graphs of functions. We will provide instructions for <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" visual="desmos.com">Desmos</url>, which is a free web-based graphing utility.

    <title>How to Create and Edit a Graph</title>
    <p>The following general steps should be used when creating effective graphs:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Enter the equation, expression, or function in the expression list.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Adjust the bounds on the x-axis and y-axis as needed to ensure that the resulting graph shows all features of the function(s) over a realistic time interval.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                If appropriate, add descriptive labels for the axes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    Note that step 2 can also be achieved with a touchscreen or mouse and keyboard. On a touchscreen, use the pinch and spread gestures with your fingers touching the axes. Alternatively, hold down the shift key on the keyboard while clicking and dragging the mouse on the axes.
</p>
</assemblage>
<example>
    <title>Graphing with Desmos</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The functions <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m> and <m>P_2(t)=100(1.02)^{t}</m> model the value <m>P</m> in dollars of two different investments after <m>t</m> years. Please do not be confused by the use of subscripts 1 and 2 on the function names; their purpose is simply to distinguish between the two functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a single graph showing <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m>. There are two intersection points: be sure that both are visible in the graph.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p> <em>Step 1: Enter the functions.</em> In the Desmos graphing calculator, we enter one equation into the expression line. Hitting enter or clicking in the space directly below the expression line brings up another line where we enter the other equation as seen below. </p>
                        <image source="images/graphing-first-step.png" width="75%"> <shortdescription>Screenshot from Desmos. Both equations are entered, but the graph shows only a portion of one line.</shortdescription></image>
    
        <p><em> Step 2: Adjust the bounds on the axes.</em> We click on the wrench icon <icon name="wrench"/> to access the Graph Settings menu in Desmos. Then, through experimentation, we adjust the intervals for the x- and y-axes until the graph shows both functions and both of the points where they intersect. (This can also be done using pinch and spread gestures on a touchscreen or holding down the Shift key while clicking and dragging on an axis.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <em> Step 3: Add labels.</em> In the Graph Settings menu, we type labels in the boxes provided. The x-axis label is "Time (yrs)" and the y-axis label is "Value ($)".
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the graph in a document or submit in an assignment, we click on the export icon <icon name="export"/> that looks like a box with a curved arrow pointing out of it. The "Export Image" option allows the graph to be downloaded as a picture file. The resulting graph is shown below.
        </p>
        <image source="images/graphing-example.png" width="50%">
            <shortdescription>Horizontal axis shows values between 0 and 200 and is labeled Time (yrs). Vertical axis shows values between 0 and 4000 and is labeled Value ($). There is a increasing linear function and an increasing exponential function. They intersect at (0,100) and near (180, 3800).</shortdescription>
        </image>
        <p>
            In the resulting graph, the straight-line is the graph of <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m> and the curve is the graph of <m>P_2(t)=100(1.02)^{t}</m>.
        </p>

    </solution>
 
</example>
<note>
    <p>
        In mathematics, we use the term <term>graph</term> very broadly to refer to to indicate both the entire image and the individual curves inside of the graph. In the previous example, the resulting <em>graph</em> contains the <em>graphs</em> of <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m> and <m>P_2(t)=100(1.02)^{t}</m>.

    <title>Using Graphs to Solve Problems</title>
    <p>
        Graphing technology can be used to evaluate functions and solve equations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Evaluate a Function:</em>  Once the function has been defined by entering it on an expression line, put your curson in a new expression line and enter your calcuation in function notation. For example, if you have defined <m>P_1(t)=100+20t</m>, you can type <m>P_1(4)</m> and hit Enter to find that value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Solve an Equation:</em>  Solutions to equations are represented graphically by intersection points. If you are solving an equation of the form <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>, the solutions are the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of <m>y=f(x)</m> and <m>y=g(x)</m> intersect.
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Fish population</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The population of an invasive fish species in a pond follows the logistic growth function <m>P(t)=\frac{200}{1+25e^{-0.04t}}</m> where <m>P</m> is the number of fish in the pond at time <m>t</m> in months after a few of the fish were accidentally introduced into the ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the population after 10 months.

                            After how many months will the population reach 100 fish?

                        <p>
                            To find the population after 10 months, we need to evaluate <m>P(10)</m>. (We know that because 10 years is a time, which is a <m>t</m> value; we are replacing <m>t</m> with 10. In Desmos, we enter <m>P(t)=\frac{200}{1+25e^{-0.04t}}</m> on an expression line and hit Enter. On the next expression line, or any available expression line, we type <m>P(10)</m> and hit Enter. The value 11.2625288342 appears. Rounding to the nearest whole fish, we conclude that there were about 11 fish in the pond after 10 months.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To determine how many months it will take the population to reach 100 fish, we will solve the equation <m>P(t)=100</m>. (We know to do this because 100 is a number of fish, which is a <m>P</m> value, so we are replacing the output with 100. That is found by determining where the graphs of <m>y=P(t)</m> and <m>y=100</m> intersect. We already have the graph of <m>y=P(t)</m> displayed from the previous part of this example. On a new expression line, we input <m>y=100</m> and adjust the viewing rectangle in the graph until we can see where the two graphs intersect. Clicking on the intersection point brings up the coordinates of the point, <m>(80.4719.100)</m>. Recall that we are looking for the time, or <m>t</m> value, which is about <m>80.5</m> months.

                The time when the value reaches $1,000,000 is the solution to the equation <m>P(t)=1000</m>. To find this solution, we will graph <m>y=P(t)</m> and <m>y=1000</m>; then find where the graphs intersect.

                The two functions intersect where <m>t=12.18206</m> which is the year <m>2016+12=2028</m>. Therefore, the home will be worth $1,000,000 in the year 2028.
