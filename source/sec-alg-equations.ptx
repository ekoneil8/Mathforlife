  <p>
    In this section, we focus on the algebraic techniques that will be used to solve problems in later chapters. These are the problem-solving techniques without the problems.

  In <xref ref="sec-modeling-lines" />, we will use linear growth models to analyze real-life situations. Here, we address just the technical skills involved.

  <p>A <term>linear equation</term> is a special type of equation in which the only power on the variable is 1. It is called linear because its graph forms a straight line.</p>

        <p>
          Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation, if needed, using the distributive property and/or combining like terms.
