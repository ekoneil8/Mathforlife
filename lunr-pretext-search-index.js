  "body": " Percents    AI-generated image of 100%.   The number 100 formed from percent symbols.    Suppose an administrator wants to compare the performance of two class sections. In one section, 23 out of 32 students passed; in the other, 18 out of 25 students passed. One way to compare their performance is by converting the fractions and to equivalent fractions with a common denominator. However, a more practical approach is to calculate and compare the percentage of students who passed each class. Using methods from this section, we find that 71.875% of the students in the first class passed, while 72% of the students in the second class passed. This shows that the second class performed slightly better than the first.     Students will be able to:     Convert between fraction, decimal, and percent form.    Calculate percents, parts, and ending amounts.    Calculate absolute and relative change.    Interpret absolute and relative change in context.      Percents  Percent, denoted by %, means “per 100,” or “parts per hundred.” The word percent comes from the Latin phrase per centum which means of a hundred. When we write 30% off, that means you save 30 out of every 100 dollars. A $100 item would be $30 off, a $200 item would be $60 off, and so on. We can write this percentage as the fraction . When we divide 30 by 100, we get We can also say you would save 30 cents out of every dollar. Many equivalent fractions can be written that equal 30%. Notice that 60 out of 200 and 15 out of 50 are also 30%, since     As an example, let's compare two jackets on sale and add some prices:    Jacket 1:    Original Price: $80    Sale: $20 off      Jacket 2:    Original Price: $100    Sale: 30% off      What is the sale price and sale percentage for each jacket? Which is the better buy?     Jacket 1:   For this jacket we have the dollar amount of the sale so we will subtract it from the original price.     Now we will divide to find the percentage of the sale:   This jacket is 25% off and the sale price is $60.   Jacket 2:   For this jacket we know the percentage off so we need to find 30% of $100. We used a base of 100 so $30 off per $100 is $30.     Then we subtract the sale amount from the original price to get:   This jacket is 30% off and the sale price is $70.  Which do you think is the better deal? You would save more with jacket 2, but jacket 1 is cheaper. If the jackets are similar in quality and desirability, jacket 1 would be a good choice. If jacket 2 is warmer, looks better on you, or offers better rain protection, you might consider whether it is worth spending an additional $10 to have a better jacket.      Converting Between Percents and Decimals  To convert a percent to decimal form, we use the definition of \"per 100.\" For example, means 82 per 100 so we divide by 100. Notice this is the same as moving the decimal two places to the left and removing the % symbol.   To go the other way, if we have , we can multiply it by 100% or move the decimal two places to the right and add the % symbol.     Change each percent to decimal form.   65%    200%    5.2%    0.1%           . Notice this is the same as moving the decimal to the left two places.     or just .     . If we use the method of moving the decimal two places to the left we use a zero to hold the place value and we get 0.052.     .         Change each fraction or decimal into percent form.        1.25    0.06    0.003          First we divide to get and then multiply by 100%. .     or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 125%.     or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 6%.     or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 0.3%. Note this is less than one percent.        Watch for Common Errors   Be careful with fractions and decimals. Banks sometimes use fractions when expressing interest rates of loans. For example, is the same as because . We can convert to decimal form by moving the decimal two places to the left to obtain .   Be careful with small percentages. For example, expressed in decimal form is . The decimal starts out to the left of the 5, and when we shift the decimal two places to the left we must fill in with two additional zeros.     Calculating Percents  When calculating percents, we divide the part by the whole amount. The whole amount is also called the base of the percentage. First we will look at how to calculate percents and then how to calculate a part.   Calculating Percents          We can also think of these formulas as sentences. The word is means equals, per means divide, and of often means multiplication. So we can also say, Percent is part per whole, and, Part is percent of whole.     In a survey of 1,031 randomly chosen adults, 577 said they would feel better if they got more sleep ( source ). What percent is this?    First, we need to identify the part and the whole. The whole is the total number of adults surveyed. The part is the 577 adults who said they would feel better if they got more sleep.  Using the formula we can calculate   About 57% of the adults surveyed said they would feel better if they got more sleep.      First estimate which quantity is the larger percentage. Then calculate both percentages.   A quiz score of 8 out of 10 or 11 out of 15.    A cereal with 2 grams of sugar in a 28 gram serving size or 3 grams of sugar in a 32 gram serving size.          We are estimating that 8 out of 10 seems larger compared to 11 out of 15 because missing 2 out of 10 seems like less than 4 out of 15.        The score of 8 out of 10 is a higher percentage.    We are estimating that 3 out of 32 is a higher percentage than 2 out of 28 because the added gram of sugar seems high compared with only a 4 gram increase in serving size.        The cereal with 3 grams of sugar out of 32 grams has a higher percentage of sugar.       Another useful tool is finding the part when we know the percent and the whole amount.    For example, say you have a high yield online savings account that pays an annual interest rate of 4.5%. If you have $3000 in the account for your emergency fund, how much interest will you earn in a year? What would your total balance be with the interest?    To perform calculations with percents, we change them into decimal form first. So we divide 4.5 by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and we get 0.045.  Then, using the formula we have     You would earn $135 in interest. Interest is added to your account so we will add to find the total balance.   Your total balance is $3,135 after one year.    Note: The example above is an example of simple interest . Most accounts use something called \" compound interest . Both types of interest are addressed in .    Find each part described and the total or ending amount.   A smartphone's battery life of 12 hours lost 20% after a year of use. Find the amount it decreased by and the current battery life.    The sales tax in Vancouver, Washington is currently 8.7%. How much tax would you pay on TV that costs $399 and what is the total price?          First we will find 20% of 12 hours by multiplying by the decimal form of the percent: Then we will subtract since the battery life went down. The phone battery life went down by 2.4 hours to 9.6 hours.    We will find 8.7% of $399 by multiplying the amount by the decimal form of the percent We rounded to the nearest cent. Then we will add since the tax is an additional cost. The tax on the TV is $34.71, which gives a total price of $433.71.       There is an optional shorter way to go about this type of problem if you are interested.  If we look at a 20% decrease as the battery retaining 80% of its life (100-20=80)%, we can calculate the new battery life directly using the decimal form   We can also do this with the TV price using addition for an increase (100+8.7=108.7)%         Percents over 100%  In many situations the part must be less than the whole so the percent cannot be more than 100%. In the shirt sale example, a store can't take off more than the cost of the shirt. If they took off 100% of the price the shirt would be free. In other situations, going over 100% does make sense. So it's important to use the context and your number sense to make sure your answer is reasonable.    A company set a goal of $50,000 in profit and actually made $120,000 in their first year. What percent of their goal is this?  Here we can see the part is higher than the whole or base amount so this answer should be over 100%.     The company's profit was 2.4 times or 240% of their goal.      Absolute and Relative Change  As we saw in the shirt sale prices, we can talk about a difference in absolute terms or relative terms. Absolute change is the actual amount of the change in dollars, people, etc. The change is positive if the value goes up and negative if it goes down. Relative change is the amount of change as a percentage of the starting amount. The relative change would have the same sign as the absolute change. Often we use words like increase or decrease to represent the sign.   Absolute and Relative Change      For example, Portland Community College recently increased its tution from $128 to $133 per credit hour. Find the absolute and relative change. First we will subtract to find out how much the tuition went up. The absolute change is an increase of $5 per credit. Now we will divide that by the original tuition of $128. The relative change is a tuition increase of about 3.9%.  The base of a percent is very important and relative change is calculated as a percentage of the original amount because that was the amount before the change.    Maria has been thinking about selling her car. The value went from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What is the absolute and relative change in the car's value?    First we will subtract to calculate the absolute change: The absolute change is a decrease of $600 in the car's value.  Now we can calculate the relative change:   The relative change in the price of the car was a decrease of about 8.1% of it's value.    Notice in the last example we either used the negative sign or the word decrease to show the direction of the change. We could say the car's value changed by -8.1% or decreased by 8.1%. We wouldn't use both at the same time because that would be a double negative. Let's look at another example.    After raises, Iryna's wage went from $22 to $25 per hour. Sundar's hourly wage went from $19 to $21.85. Calculate their absolute and relative raises. Who got a larger raise?    First we will calculate the absolute raises:    Iryna:       Sundar:       Iryna got a larger absolute raise of $3 per hour compared with $2.85 for Sundar. Now we will calculate the relative raises.       Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay.       Sundar's raise was 15% of his pay.    Sundar had a relative raise of 15% of his pay and Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay. Iryna had the larger absolute raise but Sundar had the larger raise relative to their starting wages.  Notice that instead of subtracting first, we could have divided the new pay by the base pay. For Sundar's pay we get .  This is another way to see that Sundar had a raise of 15%.    Notice in the last example that Sundar's new pay was 1.15 times his old pay or an increase of 15%. He is getting 100% of his original salary plus an additional 15%.    Doubling, Tripling, Etc.  Now let's say the company that made $120,000 in profit the first year made $240,000 in profit in their second year. We can say their profit doubled or was two times the previous year. This is a 100% increase because they matched their original profit for 100%, and they also had an increase of 100%.  In order to triple their first year's profit they would need to make $360,000 in profit. Be precise with your wording when describing percent changes because tripling their profit is an increase of 200%.    Multiple Percent Changes  We can also calculate values with multiple percent increases and decreases. We must be careful here because the base changes each time. For example, if a stock price drops by 60% in one week and increases by 75% the next week, this is not the same as an increase of 15%. The base for the drop is the original price and the base for the increase is the lower price. Let's look at this more closely in the next example.    A stock valued at $100 dropped in value by 60% one week, then increased in value the next week by 75%. Is the value higher or lower than where it started? What is the ending value and what is the combined relative change?    After one week, the value dropped by 60% so we have In the next week, the starting value of the stock is $40, so that is the new base. Computing the 75% increase we get In the end, the stock is $70, which is $30 lower, or 30% lower than it started.  If you enjoyed the shorter method we showed before, it is really useful for multiple percent changes.       Exercises   Calculations   Perform the calculations indicated in each exercise.

If you have $3000 in the account for your emergency fund, how much interest will you earn in a year? What would your total balance be with the interest?    To perform calculations with percents, we change them into decimal form first. So we divide 4.5 by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and we get 0.045.

Find the amount it decreased by and the current battery life.    The sales tax in Vancouver, Washington is currently 8.7%. How much tax would you pay on TV that costs $399 and what is the total price?          First we will find 20% of 12 hours by multiplying by the decimal form of the percent: Then we will subtract since the battery life went down. The phone battery life went down by 2.4 hours to 9.6 hours.    We will find 8.7% of $399 by multiplying the amount by the decimal form of the percent We rounded to the nearest cent. Then we will add since the tax is an additional cost. The tax on the TV is $34.71, which gives a total price of $433.71.       There is an optional shorter way to go about this type of problem if you are interested.  If we look at a 20% decrease as the battery retaining 80% of its life (100-20=80)%, we can calculate the new battery life directly using the decimal form   We can also do this with the TV price using addition for an increase (100+8.7=108.7)%      "

  "body": " Rates and Ratios    AI-generated image of rice in a microwave.   Steaming bowl of rice in a microwave.    When cooking rice, the amounts of water and rice should be proportional , meaning that the ratio of the amount of water to the amount of rice should be the same, regardless of how much rice you are cooking. For microwaved rice, that ratio is three parts water to two parts rice.  Proportional reasoning is the practice of using mathematics to solve problems involving ratios and rates, such as determining the amount of water to add to cups of rice. (You should use cups of water.)  In this section, we will explore applications of proportional reasoning in such practical situations as cooking, travel, and home improvement.     Students will be able to:     Find and interpret unit rates.    Apply conversion factors to change units.    Solve problems involving rates and ratios.      Unit Rates  Imagine that you are at the grocery store comparing the prices for two brands of pasta sauce. One costs $3.50 for one jar while the other is on sale at $11.50 for three jars.  One way to approach the problem is to compare the price per jar or unit rate of each brand. (In this particular scenario, we might use the term unit price to be more specific.) The unit rate for the first brand is $3.50 per jar. To find the unit rate for the second jar, we divide: Since the unit price of the first brand is lower, we find that it is the better deal.   Rate and Unit Rate     Rate  A rate is the ratio of two quantities with different units such as 40 miles to 2 hours or .    Unit Rate  A unit rate is a rate in which the denominator is implied to be one such as 20 miles per hour.    Unit Price  A unit price is a unit rate that communicates the cost per unit such as $0.4608 per ounce for a bag of chips.        The 2020 Census US Census Bureau, \"QuickFacts: Kitsap County, Washington, www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/kitsapcountywashington\/PST045223 reports that Kitsap County, Washington, has a population of 275,612 people and covers 395.1 square miles of land. Find the population density as a unit rate of people per square mile.           One brand of eggnog costs $6.99 for 59 fluid ounces, and another brand costs $3.99 for one quart. (There are 32 ounces in one quart.) Calculate the unit prices to determine the better deal.    For each brand, will divide the price by the volume in ounces to determine the unit price in dollars per ounce.  First brand: The unit price is $0.1185 per ounce.  Second brand: The unit price is $0.1247 per ounce.  Therefore, the first brand is a better deal. (Larger volume containers tend to be cheaper, but not always!)      At one store, bananas are $0.63 per pound. At another store, bananas cost $0.19 each. At what weight per banana is the first store's price better, and at what weight is the second store's price better?    We are given two unit prices, but the units are different.  We are looking for the weight per banana, so let's call that .  At the first store, one banana will cost .  Recall that the second store charges $0.19 for one banana. Therefore, the first store's price is better when   Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.63 and rounding to four decimal places, we obtain   This means that the first store's price is better if a banana weighs less than 0.3016 pounds.  Similarly, the second store's price is better if a banana weighs more than 0.3016 pounds.      A rockclimber burns 16 calories per minute. How long will it take them to burn 200 calories?    Using a proportion  We first express the unit rate of 16 calories per minute as a fraction: .  The rate of calories to minutes when they burn 200 calories can be expressed as a fraction using the variable to represent the number of minutes: .  The two rates must be equal, so we set up and solve an equation. (This is a special type of equation called a proportion.)   Therefore, it will take the climber 12.5 minutes to burn 200 calories.    Using \"Rate Time = Amount\"  The \"burn rate\" in calories per minute times the number of minutes will equal the total number of calories burned. Using the variable to represent the number of minutes, we can set up and solve an equation.   Therefore, it will take the climber 12.5 minutes to burn 200 calories.      Unit Conversions  To convert units, we will use the strategy of multiplying by a \"fancy one\". The technical term for this approach is dimensional analysis . For example, since one pint is equal to two cups, both of these fractions are equal to one: The fractions and are called conversion factors because they are factors (multipliers) used to convert between units.  To convert between pints and cups, we can multiply by the conversion factor that will result in the original units being \"divided out\", leaving an equivalent value in terms of the new units. For example, suppose we needed to convert cups to pints.  we start by writing cups as a fraction: .  Because we would like to \"divide out\" the cups units from the numerator, we multiply by the conversion factor that has cups in the denominator, , as follows: Because we have just multiplied by one, the value stays equivalent in the new units.  The reader may point out correctly that converting between pints and cups is done more quicky by just multiplying and dividing by two. However, when multiple conversions must be done in sequence and there are units in both the numerator and denominator of an expression, conversion factors simplify the process. Following are some more involved examples. A list of common unit conversions is found at the end of this section in .    Convert 20 miles per hour to feet per minute.    Step-by-step approach  There are 5280 feet in one mile and there are 60 minutes in one hour.  We start by writing 20 miles per hour as a fraction: .  To divide out the miles in the numerator, we will use a conversion factor with miles in the denominator; the numerator will be 5280 feet.     To divide out the hour in the denominator, we will use a conversion factor with hours in the numerator; the denominator will be 60 minutes.     Therefore, a vehicle moving 20 miles per hour travels 1,760 feet each minute.    All-at-once approach  Note that we can complete both conversions in one step as follows:   Therefore, a vehicle moving 20 miles per hour travels 1,760 feet each minute.      A recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of sugar. A home chef is quadrupling the recipe. How much sugar will they need in cups?    They will need tablespoons of sugar.  We make use of the conversions that there are two tablespoons in an ounce and eight ounces in a cup.   The home chef should use of a cup of sugar.      Proportional Reasoning with Rates and Ratios  There are many real-life problems in which proportional reasoning can be applied. Some examples from various contexts follow.    You are making many pizzas for a large party. Your favorite recipe makes 20 ounces of dough, which is the right amount for two 12-inch diameter pizzas. You plan to make six 16-inch pizzas for the party. By what factor should you multiply or scale the recipe, and how many ounces of dough will that make?    Assume that the thickness of a 16-inch pizza is the same as the thickness of a 12-inch pizza. You can compare the total area of pizza made from one recipe with the total area of pizza you plan to make for the party.  The formula for the area of a circle of radius is . Recall that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter, so the original recipe makes two 6-inch radius pizzas and you want to make six 8-inch radius pizzas. Those areas are as follows:   Original Recipe: Two pies of radius 6 inches      For Party: Six pies of radius 8 inches   The ratio of the area of pizza needed for the party to the area of pizza made by one recipe is   When we make the dough, we will multiply the amount of each ingredient by , which is the factor you should use to scale up the recipe.  The resulting amount of dough should be ounces. For context, that is 6.67 pounds of dough. You will need a very large bowl!      Have you ever wondered how the speedometer on a car works? A car with 15.8-inch radius tires will move inches with each revolution. If the wheels are spinning 620 revolutions per minute, how fast is the car moving in miles per hour?    Our goal is to convert 620 revolutions per minute (rpm) to miles per hour. To do this, we will start with the expression and apply the following conversions:   Convert revolutions to inches using the fact that each revolution moves the car inches.    Convert inches to feet and then feet to miles. There are 12 inches in one foot, and there are 5280 feet in one mile.    Convert minutes to hours.      Note that all of the units divide away exept the miles in the numerator and the hours in the denominator. Therefore, the car is moving 58 miles per hour.  The above conversions can be done in any order, as long as we are careful about which units are in the numerator and which are in the denominator.   Comment: Most modern cars have electric sensors that measure the rotational speed (rpm) of the wheels and send that information to the car's computer. The computer converts the rotational speed to linear speed in miles per hour. Because the calculation uses the tire size, if a car has the wrong sized tires, its speedometer will display an incorrect speed.      A one-gallon can of paint covers about 350 square feet. A room with nine-foot ceilings is 16 feet long and 14 feet wide. The room has two windows, each 36 inches wide and 52 inches high, and it has one door that is 30 inches wide and 80 inches tall.  The homeowner wishes to paint the walls of the room, excluding the windows and doors. How many cans of paint should the homeowner purchase?    The room has two walls that are 16 feet long and nine feet high, and it has two walls that are 14 feet long and nine feet high. The resulting total area of walls is   Now we will find the areas of the windows and door. Note that the units are converted from inches to feet.  Windows: The area of each window is 13 square feet.  Door: The area of the door is about 16.67 square feet.  Now we subtract to find the resulting area that will be painted: The homeowner has about 497.33 square feet of wall space that need to be painted.  Since each can covers about 350 square feet, the homeowner can expect to use cans.  They should purchase two cans of paint.      Common Unit Conversions   Units of Length             Units of Volume        Note that milliliters and cubic centimeters are the same unit and can be used interchangeably.    Units of Weight and Mass        The conversion between kilograms, which is a mass, and pounds, which is a weight, is valid for locations on the surface of the Earth. If you were to go to Mars, your mass (how big you are) would remain the same but your weight (how much force you exert on a scale due to gravity) would be reduced due to the weaker gravitational pull.  Since we live on the surface of the Earth, it is generally safe to convert between kilograms and pounds without worrying about the physics of mass and weight.     Exercises   Find the unit rate for each size and determine which is more cost effective? A 9.6-ounce cannister of coffee for $5.42 or a 40.3-ounce cannister of coffee for $14.87.

  "body": " Focus on Dosage Calculations    AI-generated image of assorted medications.   Assorted medications    Nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers must be proficient in calculating dosages of medications to ensure that patients receive a safe but effective dose. In this section, we address the proportional reasoning involved in these calculations.     Students will be able to:     Calculate dosages of medications.    Determine if dosages meet safety guidelines.      Calculating Dosages  In calculating dosages, we will use the approach of multiplying by a conversion factor, or a \"fancy 1\".    The provider ordered 8,000 units of heparin. The vial is labeled 10,000 units\/ml. What volume will you administer?    We need to convert 8,000 units into mililiters to determine the volume of medication to be administered to the patient. Since , we have two conversion factors to choose from: or Starting with , we multiply by the conversion factor that has \"units\" in the denominator to ensure that the \"units\" divide out. Therefore, 0.8 ml of heparin should be administered to the patient.    Many prescriptions use latin abbreviations to indicate how often the medication should be administered. Some of the more common abbreviations are listed below.   Dosage Abbreviations     bid  Twice per day (Latin: bis in die)    tid  Three times per day (Latin: ter in die)    qid  Four times per day (Latin: quarter in die)    qd  Every day (Latin: quaqua die); may also be written as od for once daily    q3h  Every three hours (Latin: quaqua 3 hora); can generalize to any number of hours    gtt or gtts  Drops (Latin: gutta); typically drips of fluid administered intravenously (IV drip)      Additionally, dosage calculations may require converting units. Some of the more commonly used conversions are listed below.   Common Unit Conversions        Note: in the international system of units, micrograms are denoted as . To avoid potentially disastrous results that might arise from confusing with mg, the medical community uses the abbreviation mcg for micrograms.     The provider orders a maintenance dose of oral aminophylline, 3 mg\/kg q6h. The client weighs 110 lbs. How many mg should the nurse administer to the client in a 24-hour period?    First, we will find the client's weight in kg:   Next, we determine the amount of aminophylline administered in each dose:   Since the dose is given every 6 hours, there will be doses in each 24-hour period. This amounts to each day.      The physician ordered Norpace, 0.6 grams by mouth daily divided in four doses.   Norpace is available in 150 mg capsules. How many capsules are needed in each dose?    The safety guidelines for Norpace state that the safe effective dose is 6-15 mg\/kg\/day. The patient weighs 99 lbs. Is the prescribed dose safe?          First, we convert 0.6 grams to miligrams:   We divide to determine the size of each dose: .  Since each capsule contains 150 mg, we should administer 1 capsule for each dose.    To determine if this dose is within safety guidelines, we must first convert 99 pounds to kilograms:   From the previous part, we know that the daily dose is 600 mg. We divide to determine how many miligrams per kilogram this works out to be administered each day: .  Since 13.3 is between 6 and 15, we can confirm that this is a safe dose.        Person monitoring an IV   Someone wearing scrubs holds an IV bag; we see only their arm    Some intravenously-administered medications are given as an infusion , meaning the IV line is controlled to administer a set number of drops per minute. It is important to administer infusions at the correct rate for the given medication and patient.  IV tubing administration sets come in various sizes, and the size is measured by the drip factor, also called the drop factor. For example, if a tubing set has a drip factor of 12 gtts\/mL, then there are 12 drops in each milliliter.  While the size of each drop is fixed, the nurse can set how many drops of fluid are released each minute. A typical infusion dosage calculation will involve converting mL\/min to gtts\/min as follows.    A medication has been prepared in an IV bag. The patient needs 100 milliliters to be infused over 30 minutes. If the tubing drop factor is 20 gtts\/mL, how many gtts\/min should be administered? Round to the nearest whole number.    The fluid must be infused at a rate of 100 mL per 30 min, or mL\/min.  We use the drop factor to convert to gtts\/min: The IV should be set to administer 67 gtts\/min.       A nurse is preparing to 1 g of cefadroxil. The medication is supplied in 500 mg tablets. How many tablets should the nurse administer?   2 tablets   An adult client with renal cancer, weighing 95 kg, is to receive vincristing 25 mcg\/kg\/day. What is the daily dosage in mg?   2.375 mg    The physician orders acetaminophen 15 mg\/kg q4h or less frequently as needed for an infant's pain. The drug is supplied with 160 mg per 5 ml. The infant weighs 12 pounds. What volume of medication, in ml, should be administered in each dose?   2.56 ml    A pediatric patient weighing 33 lbs is receiving intravenous antibiotics for otitis media (ear infection). The drug guide states that a safe dose for this medication is 15-30 mg\/kg\/day in three divided doses. The provider has ordered 205 mg tid.     Is this a safe dose?    What are the safe doses parameters? In other words, what are the lowest and highest doses that should be administered?         This is not a safe dose.    75-150 mg tid       A patient is receiving a 0.9% saline solution, which is salt (sodium chloride) dissolved in water at a rate of 0.9 grams per 100 milliliters. The solution is administered via IV at a rate of 125 ml\/hr. How many milligrams of salt has the patient received after five hours?   5,625 mg    The physician ordered Nitroprusside 2.7 mcg\/kg\/min. The patient weighs 136 pounds. Available is 250 mg of Nitroprusside dissolved in 500 mL of a solution of dextrose and water (D5W). The medication will be administered via an infusion pump programmed by the nurse. How many mL per hour should the pump be programmed to give the patient? Round to the nearest whole number.   About 20 mL\/hr    The physician ordered Dopamine: 4.5 mcg\/kg\/min. The patient weighs 78.2 kilograms. Available is 400 mg of Dopammine dissolved in 500 mL of D5W. How many mL\/hr should the nurse program the infusion pump to administer? Round to the nearest whole number.   26 mL\/hr    The physician ordered 17 mg\/kg\/day of Carbamazepine to be divided into two daily doses. The patient weighs 29.4 kilograms. On hand are 100-mg tablets. How many tablets should be administered in each dose? Round to the nearest tenth.   2.5 tablets per dose    50 mL of Albumin 5% needs to be administered intravenously over 15 minutes. The tubing drop factor is 10 gtts\/mL, meaning that there are 10 drops in each milliliter of fluid. How many gtts\/minute, or drops per minute, should be administered?   33 gtts\/min    A medication is being administered at a rate of 48 gtts\/min, and the tubing drop factor is 60 gtts\/mL. How fast in mL\/hr is the medication being infused?   48 mL\/hr    "

  "body": " Linear Growth    AI-generated image of a plant growing according to a linear model.   A row of green plants, each sequentially larger than the next, with coordinate axes and a linear graph superimposed over the tops of the plants.    Linear growth occurs when quantities increase or decrease at a constant rate over time, which is common in real-life scenarios like budgeting, population changes, and transportation. Understanding linear growth helps us make predictions, solve problems, and analyze trends in fields like science, economics, and everyday decision-making.     Students will be able to:     Identify linear growth in context.    Interpret linear growth models.    Use linear growth models to solve applied problems.      Linear Growth Models  A linear growth model is an equation used to represent something that changes by the same amount in each unit of time. We use the term growth even in situations where a quantity is decreasing by the same amount in each unit of time. (It is growing by a negative amount.) Following are some examples of linear growth:     A tree is 4 feet tall when it is planted, and it grows 2 feet each year.    The value of a car is $38,000 when new, and the value decreases by $2,000 each year.    The total cost to repair a dishwasher is $100 plus $80 for each hour of labor.    The population of a small town is 4,070 people in the year 2025, and it is increasing by 5 people per year.     In each example, the value changes by the same amount in each unit of time: 2 feet each year, $2,000 each year, $80 each hour, and 5 people each year.  Consider the tree that starts out 4 feet tall and grows 2 feet each year. After 1 year, it will be 6 feet tall, after 2 years it will be 8 feet tall, after 3 years it will be 10 feet tall, and so on.  We can demonstrate the growth pattern with a table and a graph.   Tree growth over time    Time (yrs)  Height (ft)    0  4    1  6    2  8    3  10    4  12    5  14    6  16     By convention, we put time on the horizontal axis when dealing with growth models. Plotting the points in the table above results in the following graph.   Linear growth pattern   Graph showing points in the tree growth over time table    Note that if we connect the data points, the result would be a straight line , which is why we call this type of trend linear growth .  Imagine that we wanted to predict the height of the tree after 20 years. We would start with the initial height of 4 feet and add 2 feet 20 times. Mathematically, this is .  Generalizing, we can obtain a formula for the height of the tree after years:   Recall from algebra classes that indicates function notation, not multiplication. We read it as \" of \".  As expected, the graph of is a straight line.   Graph of .   Graph of H(t)=4+2t for t between 0 and 7.    Using a similar approach we can write linear functions to model the remaining examples mentioned above:     The value of the car that starts out at $38,000 and loses $2,000 in value each year can be modeled with the function .    The $100 plus $80 per hour cost to repair the dishwasher can be modeled with the function where is measured in hours.    The population of the town that starts at 4,070 and grows by 5 people per year since the year 2025 can be modeled with the function where is the number of years since 2025.      Linear Growth Model  Linear growth can be modeled with functions of the form where    is the amount at time ,     is the initial amount,     is the common difference or growth rate , which is the amount of growth in each unit of time, and    t  is the amount of time.   Note that can be negative.    Is the linear growth model equivalent to the slope-intercept form of a line from middle school and high school algebra classes? Yes, it is!  The general linear growth model equation above uses the letter because population models are one of the more common applications.  The constant can be read \"P sub zero\", \"P zero\", or \"P naught\", and it represents the population or value at time zero. When viewing the graph, the point where line intersects the vertical or y-axis is called the y-intercept. Its coordinates are .  Recall that linear growth occurs when a value changes by the same amount in each unit of time, and growth can be either positive or negative depending on whether the value is increasing or decreasing.    Identify whether each scenario is an example of linear growth. If it is linear growth, find the initial value, the common difference or growth rate, and the equation.   A projectile starts at ground level. It reaches its maximum height of 40 feet after two seconds and lands after four seconds. Is the height of the projectile a linear function of time?   The height increases and then decreases. Therefore, it does not have a constant rate of change, and it is not linear. (It is quadratic.)     The population of a small town is 1,042 people in the year 2015, and the population grows by 19 people per year. Is the population a linear function of time?   The growth rate is a constant 19 people per year, so this is linear growth. If we let be the year 2015, then the initial value is and the growth rate is 19 people per year.  The equation is .     The population of a small town is 1,042 people in the year 2015, and the population grows by 2.9% per year. Is the population a linear function of time?   The first year, the population grows by 2.9% of 1042, which is about 30 people or a new population of 1072 people. The second year, the population grows by 2.9% of 1072, which is about 31 people. The amount of growth is not the same, so this is not linear growth. (It is exponential growth.)     For tax and planning purposes, a business estimates that a tractor purchased for $28,000 will be worth $0 after seven years of use. It depreciates by the same amount each year. Is the reported value of the tractor a linear function of time?   This is linear because the value depreciates by the same amount each year. The initial value is dollars. The common difference dollars each year. The resulting equation is where is the value in dollars after years.     The population of Poulsbo, Washington, was about 9,300 people in 2010, about 12,000 people in 2020, and about 12,200 people in 2024. Is the population of Poulsbo a linear function of time?   To determine if this is linear growth, we will determine the growth rates from 2010 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2024 to see if they are the same.  From 2010 to 2020, the population grew by people in 10 years, which is a growth rate of people per year.  From 2020 to 2024, the population grew by 200 people in four years, which is a growth rate of people per year. Since the growth rates are not approximately equal, the population of Poulsbo is not growing linearly.          Kobi drives an average of 1,050 miles each month. They just purchased a used car with 43,000 miles on the odometer.   Develop a linear model to represent the number of miles on the odometer after months.   Measuring time in months since Kobi purchased the car, the initial value is . The common difference is miles per month. Therefore, we can build the model where is measured in months and is the number of miles on the odometer.     Use the model to estimate the mileage after 2 years.   Two years is the same as months. Substituting into our function model and evaluating yields miles.     Use the model to determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles.   Algebraic Approach  To determine when the mileage will reach 100,000 miles, we set the mileage equal to 100,000 and solve for .   The car will have 100,000 miles on the odometer in about 54 months, or about 4.5 years.    Graphical Approach  We can use graphing technology, such as desmos to solve the problem. Using the method demonstrated in , we obtain the following graph.   Graph of an increasing linear function and a horizontal line. The point (24,68200) is labeled on the linear function, and the point (54.28571,100000) is labeled at the intersection of the two lines.   The mileage reaches 100,000 miles at , which is about 54 months.          When Good Models Go Bad  When using any mathematical model, it is important to consider how long the model will be valid. At the beginning of this section, we discussed the example of a tree that grows two feet per year from an initial height of four feet. Is it reasonable to think that the tree will grow about two feet each year forever? Is it reasonable to think that it was growing by two feet per year before it was planted at time ? Probably not. It is likely that the tree will grow by two feet per year for several years, perhaps five to ten or even twenty years, before the rate of growth slows down. If the tree is left to live a natural lifesapn, eventually it will stop growing, die, and decompose. The model may be useful for a limited interval of time, such as five to ten years before its validity breaks down.  How far into the future will a linear model serve as a valid predictor? Engineers and statisticians use error analysis methods involving calculus to find approximate answers to this question. In this book, we will use knowledge of the examples at hand to estimate realistic bounds.    An espresso machine for a coffee stand is purchased for $15,000. For tax and planning purposes, the owner reports that the machine will depreciate linearly over ten years. Find a model to represent the reported value after years and estimate the interval over which the model will be valid.    The starting value of the machine is . The rate of change is Therefore, we can use the model where is the number of years since the espresso machine was purchased and is the reported value in dollars.  It does not make sense to consider the value of the machine before it was purchased or after its value has dropped to $0. Therefore, this model should be valid for values of between and . This is only an estimate because the machine could break earlier or changing economic conditions could raise or lower the reported value.      The price of a one-term subscription to an online mathematics homework system was $100 in 2019. The price has been increasing linearly, and the same subscription cost $142 in 2025.   Find a model to represent the price of the subscription years after the year 2019.    Based on the situation, over which of following intervals for would you anticipate that this model will be valid?      to      to      to                   The starting value is given to be $100.  Before finding the rate of change, we note that the year 2025 is , so our two ordered pairs are and . Now we can find that the rate of change is dollars per year.  Therefore, the model is .    There is no one correct interval on which this model will be valid. However, the interval to is most reasonable because it contains the years 2019, which is , and 2025, which is , but not too much more.          A plumber charges a service fee of $120 plus $90 per hour. Create a linear model for the total cost for hours of plumbing work.        A middle schooler borrowed $300 from their parents to buy a Nintendo Switch gaming console. They will pay it off by doing extra work around their house for $10 per hour.   Write a function to model the amount they will owe after working hours.    The middle schooler will work 15 hours per week. Write a function to model the amount they will owe after weeks.                      An excavation company purchased a bulldozer for $49,000. For tax and insurance purposes, they report that the value will depreciate linearly over 10 years, meaning that in 10 years the bulldozer will be valued at $0.   Find a model for the value of the bulldozer after years.    What is the value after two years?    After how many years will the value have dropped to $14,700?                   After 7 years       In 2018, a school population was 1,354. By 2021 the school had growth to 1,573 students.   Assuming the population grows according to a linear model, what is the annual growth rate?    Find a linear model for the population as a function of where is the number of years since 2018.    Use the model to predict the school population in the year 2028.    Use the model to predict the year when the school population will reach 2,960 students.         73 Students per year          students    The year 2040       In 2022, Olympic College had 8,143 students. In 2024, Olympic College had 8,938 students. If the number of students increases linearly, in what year will Olympic College have 12,000 students? Round to the nearest year.   There will be 12,000 students in the year 2032.    A car rental company charges $160 per week plus $0.15 per mile to rent a car. How many miles can you travel in one week for a total cost of $257.50?   650 miles    A health and beauty spa purchased a $29,000 laser machine to treat acne, wrinkle, and other blemishes. If the machine will be depreciated over 8 years, when will it be valued at $20,000? Round to the nearest tenth of a year.   After about 2.5 years    A driver pulled up to a gas pump when there were 1.7 gallons of gas remaining in their car's fuel tank. After pumping gas for 66.5 seconds, the 15-gallon fuel tank was full.   Find a function to model the volume of gas in the tank as a function of time seconds after starting pumping the gas.    What is the slope of the linear model and what does it represent in terms of the situation? Be sure to use appropriate units in your answer.    What is the y-intercept of the linear model and what does it represent in terms of the situation? Be sure to use appropriate units in your answer.              The slope is 0.2. It represents that the gas flows into the tank at a rate of 0.2 gallons per second.    The y-intercept is . It represents that the starting volume of gas in the tank was 1.7 gallons.       Challenge Exercises   Solve each problem.    A clothing business finds there is a linear relationship between the number of shirts it sells in a quarter and the price they charge for shirt. Market research shows that 10,000 shirts can be sold at a price of $107 each while 56,000 shirts can be sold at a price of $15 each. What price should the retailer set if they wish to sell 20,000 shirts, and what price should they set to sell 30,000 shirts?   To sell 20,000 shirts they should charge $87, and to sell 30,000 shirts they should charge $67.    The manager of a furniture factory finds that the total cost to manufacture 100 chairs in one day is $2,200 and the total cost to manufacture 300 chairs in one day is $4,800.   Find an equation for the total cost to manufacture chairs in one day. Assume that the cost is a linear function of the number of chairs.    What is the slope of the linear model and what does it represent in terms of the situation? Be sure to use appropriate units in your answer.    What is the y-intercept of the linear model and what does it represent in terms of the situation? Be sure to use appropriate units in your answer.              The slope is 13. This represents that the production cost per chair is $13, excluding any overhead costs.    The y-intercept is $900. This represents the overhead costs such as the cost to own annd maintain the factory and machinery.        "

What is the y-intercept of the linear model and what does it represent in terms of the situation? Be sure to use appropriate units in your answer.              The slope is 13. This represents that the production cost per chair is $13, excluding any overhead costs.    The y-intercept is $900. This represents the overhead costs such as the cost to own annd maintain the factory and machinery.     "

Interpret exponential models and their outputs in context.      Exponential Growth and Decay Models  The next growth model we will examine is exponential growth. Linear growth occurs when a population increases by the same amount in each unit of time. Exponential growth happens when an initial population increases by the same percentage or factor in each unit of time.  For example, consider a town of 1,000 people that is experiencing a population boom due to an abundance of jobs and affordable housing. The population grows exponentially by 20% per year. After one year, there will be people. The next year, the population will grow by 20% of 1,200 people, so there will be people. The year after that, there will be people.  Let's compare this population that start with 1,000 people and grows by 20% per year, which is exponential growth, with a population that starts with 1,000 people and grows by 200 people per year, which is linear growth.   Linear and Exponential Growth    Year  Population Subject to Linear Growth  Population Subject to Exponential Growth    0  1000  1000    1  1200  1200    2  1400  1440    3  1600  1728    4  1800  2074    5  2000  1488    10  3000  6192     Please notice that at first, the populations according the the two models are very close, but as time goes on, the exponential model becomes increasingly larger than the linear model. This is because the linear model grows by the same amount in each unit of time while the exponential model grows by an increasing amount in each unit of time. We can use a graph to help visualize the difference between linear and exponential growth.   Linear and Exponential Growth   Graph of linear growth which is a straight line and exponential growth which at first nearly matches the linear growth but then grows faster and faster.     Duck Population   A population of ducks in a park grows exponentially. Initially, there were 200 ducks, and the population grows by 10% per month.     Find the population after one month.    Find the population after two months.    Find the population after ten months.    Develop a formula for the duck population after months.          After one month, the population will have increased by . The new population is 220 ducks.   Important Observation: We just calculated . Factoring out the 200, this is the same as which can be simplified to     In the second month, the population begins at 220 ducks and increases by . The new population is 242 ducks.   Important Observation: Using the same logic above, we could have calculated this as . Recall that we found 220 by multiplying , so the population after 2 months will be .    Consider the \"important observations\" in the first parts of this example. To find the population after ten months, we can start with the initial population of 200 ducks and multiply by a factor of 1.1 for each month. Using exponential form, that is, ducks.    Generalizing the answer to the previous part of this exercise, we obtain .       We can generalize the solution to the above example to develop a formula for exponential growth. In the function , what do the 200, the 1.1, and the represent in context?  200 is the initial or starting duck population. Recall from that we use to represent the initial value.  We found the value 1.1 by adding 1 and 0.10, which represents the 10% exponential growth rate. We can also think of 1.1=1.10 as meaning that after each month there are 110% as many ducks as there were in the previous month. We will use the variable to represent the exponential growth rate. So we have .  We will continue to use the variable to represent time using units that are appropriate to the situation, such as years, months, days, etc.  Putting this information together, we can build the exponential growth model .   Exponential Growth Model   where   is the population or value at time ,   is the initial population or value, and   is the relative growth rate in decimal or fraction form.   is positive if the population or value is increasing, and is negative if the population or value is decreasing.    Population Growth   Develop an exponential model for the population of a small town with an initial population of 2,000 people and an annual growth rate of 2.75%    We can measure population as the number of people, so .  We will measure time in years since we are given an annual growth rate. Therefore, .  The model of the form is which we can simplify to .     Population Decline   Develop an exponential model for the population of a city with an initial population of 2,000,000 people and is losing 4% of its population each year.    For simplicity, we can choose to measure the population in millions, so .  We will measure time in years since we are given an annual rate. Because the town is losing population, the growth rate is negative . Thus, .  The resulting equation of the form is which we can simplify to .     Inflation   The average inflation rate in October, 2024, was 2.6% per year. If a new car cost $35,000 in October, 2024, how much would it cost to buy the same kind of car new in October, 2030? You may assume that the price of new cars will increase with inflation.    Let's use to denote October, 2024, and count time in years. The initial value is and the growth rate is .  The value of the car after years can be found using the formula . We can simplify this expression to .  We are looking for the population in the year 2030, which is . Therefore, in 2030 a new car would cost .     Spread of Disease   In the early days of an epidemic or pandemic, disease spreads according to an exponential model. On March 13, 2020, Kitsap County, Washington, had a total of seven confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. By March 22 of that year, there were 31. If the disease continued to spread at the same exponential rate, how many cases would have accumulated by March 27? How many by April 27? (Round the growth rate to four decimal places.)    Let's start by writing down what we know and what we need to find:     We are told that this is exponential growth, so we will use the formula where is the total of accumulated positive cases at time .    The initial value is where corresponds to March 13, 2020.    On March 22, there were 31 total cases. Measuring time in days, March 22 is day . Then we can translate the number of cases on March 22 into mathematical notation as .    We do not know the growth rate , but we can set up an equation using the above information to find it.    Once we finish building our function, we can use the function to find the predicted total number of positive COVID tests on March 27 and April 13 of 2020.     To find the value of the growth rate, , we will plug in the values of and and solve the resulting equation as follows:      The growth rate was about 17.98% per day.  To calculate the ninth root on a calculator, you can use the nth root button which is likely to look like . The keyboard shortcut in the DESMOS calculator is nthroot .  Now we can assemble the function: We can simplify to .  Finally, we can use this function to answer the questions.  March 27 is day . TO find the number of cases on day 14, we evaluate cases. (In reality, there were 70 cases on this date, so the prediction is very close!)  April 13 is exactly one month after March 13. Since there are 31 days in march, this is day . To find the number of cases accumulated on this day, we evaluate cases.(In reality, there were only 135 cases on this date. We may infer that the infection had already stopped spreading at an exponential rate.)  $0     Exponential Decay   Hydrogen-3, also known as tritium, is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen and a byproduct of nuclear energy production. It decays exponentially with a half-life of 12 years, meaning that after 12 years, the amount of tritium in a sample is reduced by half. (The decayed tritium doesn't just disappear; it is converted to helium, releasing an electron and a small amount of radiation in the process.) If there are 40 grams of tritium now, how much will be left in 6 years? Round the growth rate to six decimal places.    First we will build a model of the form where time is measured in years and the is measured in grams. We are given that .  Since the half-life of tritium is 12 years, we know that after 12 years, we will be left with half of our 40-gram starting amount. We can solve this equation for .     The growth rate is negative because the amount of tritium is decreasing.  The resulting model is , which can be simplified to .  We are looking for the amount remaining after 6 hours. Therefore, there are 28g of tritium remaining after 6 hours.   Comment: It would be very tempting to observe that 6 hours is half of a half-life. If 20 grams of tritium decay in 12 hours, why don't 10 grams of tritium decay in 6 hours, leaving 30 grams? This type of proportional reasoning only works with linear models where the value changes by the same amount in each unit of time. With exponential decay, the rate of change is a percentage of the amount of substance remaining at each point in time. So the rate of change is not constant.      When Good Models Go Bad  Recall that in , the exponential model worked well in predicting , the total confirmed positive cases by March 22, but the prediction for , the total confirmed positive cases by April 13 was not even close to the actual value. The graph below shows the number of accululated cases by day and the graph of the function we built to model the situation.   Total accumulated covid cases in Kitsap County, WA, and exponential model . Data obtained from Kitsap Public Health Department.   Graph of the exponential model closely matches data points for t between -6 and 15. After t=15, the exponential model continues to veer upward while the data points level off.    The function closely models the number of cases very early in the pandemic, but the model appears to break down after about which is March 25 when the number of cases appears to start leveling off. This could be related to the \"Stay Home, Stay Healthy\" executive order announced on March 23, 2020, which banned social gatherings and closed all but essential businesses to in-person work.  In practice, all exponential models break down eventually. It is not feasible for something to keep growing forever. Populations will run out of space or resources, and conditions will change.  Like linear models, exponential models are useful tools for short-term predictions but should be used with caution for long-term predictions.    Special Cases  The general formula can be applied broadly in exponential growth and decay applications. However, with a few minor adjustments, we can create special models to save time in some common situations.  In , we found that . Using this exact value, we can write the function as   Recall the exponent rules that and . Using these rules, we can simplify the function as follows:      The model shows both the initial value and the half-life of 12 years in the function!  In general, we can model exponential decay with the formula where is the initial amount and is the half-life.   Use the Half-Life Model to Build a Function   A sample of a radioactive substance with half-life 27 seconds has an initial amount of 12 kilograms. Write an exponential function to model the amount of the substance in kilograms remaining after seconds.    P(t)=12 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}right)^{\\frac{t}{27}}     Half-Life Model Interpretation   A sample of a radioactive substance decays according to the model , where is measured in grams and is measured in hours. What is the inital amount of the substance, and what is the half-life?    The initial amount is grams, and the half-life is hours.    In population studies, it is common to focus on the doubling time , or the amount of time it takes for a population to double in size. We can make a simple adjustment on the half-life model to develop a doubling-time model: where is the doubling time for the population.   Use the Doubling-Time Model to Build and Apply a Function   A sample of bacteria in a petri dish begins with 4 cells. The population doubles every 5 hours. How many bacterial cells will there be after 12 hours?     bacteria cells.    We can generalize the half-life and doubling-time models to apply to any multiplier. If a value is multiplied by every units of time, we can model the situation with an exponential function of the form .   Using a Multiplier   A new house was sold for $400,000 in 2011. In 2021 the house was worth $600,000. If home values continue to grow exponentially at the same relative rate, what will the home's value be in 2029? Round to the nearest dollar.    For simplicty, we will measure the value in thousands of dollars and time in years since 2011. Thus, .  The multiplier is , and it took years. We will use the model   To find the value of the house in the year 2029, which is time , we evaluate .  Remembering that the value we found is in thousands of dollars, we conclude that the house will be worth about $1,244,846 in the year 2029.  Note that you could also have taken the approach of and other examples in which we used a model of the form , which required several algebraic steps to first solve for the value of . Both approaches will work equally well!     Summary: Special Cases  Exponential decay with half-life :   Exponential growth with doubling time :   Generalized shortcuts:    The value is multiplied by or increased by every units of time.

We will make use of the exponent property for logarithms.   Common Logarithm Exponent Property      We can use this fact to solve exponential equations, such as .  The first step is to use algebra to isolate the exponential part, .     Now we take the common logarith of both sides of the equation and use the exponent property to simplify.   We now have multiplied by , so we can use division to solve for .      "

  "body": " Natural Growth and Logistic Growth   Natural Growth  Consider a frog population that starts with 100 frogs and doubles each year, which is an annual increase of 100%. Is that the same as a population that increases by 50% every six months? Is that the same as a population that increases by 25% every three months? Let's explore:   Population after One Year    Model  Number of Increases in 1 Year  Population after 1 Year    Increase 100% Each Year      Increase 50% every 6 Months      Increase by 25% every 3 Months       The results are not the same! The more times we apply the increases, the larger the population grows in one year. This is happening even when the growth rate is scaled down proportionally.  Let's generalize. If the frog population increases times per year by , then after one year the population will be . If the value of approaches infinity, meaning that the increases are applied continuously rather than at distinct points in time, the results approach about frogs as seen in the table below.   Population after 1 Year as n Increases                         The number is a mathematical constant approximately equal to . Like the number , it is irrational and also arises frequently in mathematics. The frog population is, in fact, approaching .  We can use the number to develop a model for exponential growth in which the growth rate is applied continuously . This is called the Natural Growth Model because it arises frequently in the natural world when modeling population growth and exponential decay.   The Natural Growth Model  The Natural Growth Model is where is the initial amount, is the instantaneous or continuous growth rate expressed in decimal form, and is time.     An elk herd begins with 27 animals and grows at a continuous rate of per year. Write a function to model the population. Then find the population after three years.  Because this is a continuous growth rate, we should use the natural growth model with and . Therefore, the model is:   To find the population after 3 years, we evaluate on a calculator. The result is Therefore, there will be about 30 elk after three years.  Note: your calculator should have an button! You should never need to type in a decimal approximation for .     Caution!  Be careful not to confuse yearly growth rates with continuous growth rates.  For example, a population with a continuous growth rate of per year will end up increasing by about from one year to the next. This is because the growth is, effectively, broken down into infinitely many shorter time spans and the growth compounds.    "

  "body": " Introduction to Spreadsheets    Students will be able to:     Perform basic calculations on a spreadsheet.    Create cell reference formulas.    Apply the fill-down feature to perform multiple calculations simultaneously.      A spreadsheet, such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, is a very useful tool for doing calculations and making complex tables. You can type in your own custom calculations and use built-in formulas.  The rectangles within a spreadsheet are called cells , and they can be referenced by their column letter and row number. The first cell in the upper left side highlighted below is A1. If we wanted to talk about the third column and the fifth row, that cell would be C5.    A blank spreadsheet with the cell A1 highlighted    A spreadsheet file can contain many sheets. Look along the bottom to see if there is more than one sheet and make sure you are on the right sheet.    A blank spreadsheet showing the sheet tabs at the bottom of the screen.      Basic Calculations  To perform a calculation on a spreadsheet, type an equal sign before the operation. This lets the program know that you want it to calculate the result. When you press enter, you will see the result.       To add 3 + 4, enter =3+4     To subtract 100-76, enter =100-76     To multiply 4 times 18, enter =4*18     To divide 0.05 by 12, enter =0.05\/12     To calculate , enter =5^25       A spreadsheet showing the examples entered in the spreadsheet. cell A1 has =3+4, cell A2 has =100-76, cell A3 has =4*18, cell A4 has =0.05\/12 and cell A5 has =5^25.     Note that the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication. Spreadsheets don't recognize parentheses as indicators of multiplication like calculators do, so even if you have parentheses for the order of operations, the asterisk is also needed.  You can make more complicated mathematical expressions using parentheses and other operations. To edit a cell click on the editing box at the top, or double click on the cell to edit it directly.    Your bill at a restaurant is $35.75 and you want to leave an 18% tip. How much should you add to the bill?    We will use the approach of converting the percentage into a decimal and multiplying it by the base amount.  In a spreadsheet we type =0.18*35.75   and get a result of $6.44, rounded to the nearest cent . You would leave a tip of $6.44.      Cell References  One of the powerful things about spreadsheets is using a cell reference, such as C5 in a calculation. When you use a cell reference , the values automatically update if any of the referenced cells change.  Let's make a spreadsheet for the percentage tip example above. We calculated an 18% tip on a bill of $35.75. We might want to tip 18% in general, but our bill will change values. We labeled the first column Bill Amount and the second column Tip. The amount of $35.75 is entered in cell A2. Then when we write our formula in B2, we want to calculate 18% of A2. That way if the number in A2 changes, our tip will automatically update.    A spreadsheet showing a formula with a cell reference, =0.18*A2    The formula =0.18*A2 is entered in B2 which gives a result of $6.44 when you hit enter.    The same spreadsheet showing when the input in A1 is changed to $45, the answer to the formula changes to $8.10.    When the bill amount is changed, the tip is recalculated automatically.    Cell Formatting  We can format cells A1 and B1 to show dollar signs by clicking on the dollar sign in the number formatting menu.    Fill-Down Feature  The fill-down feature is very useful for making tables. This allows us to copy values, patterns, or formulas to save time. Let's make a tipping reference table with values from $10, to $100, in increments of $10. First, we will enter two values in column A to establish the pattern. Then select those two cells and you will see a small square in the lower right corner. Drag that square down until you get to $100.    A spreadsheet showing the fill-down feature; cells A2 and A3 are highligted for the pattern and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.      This spreadsheet shows the completed bill amount column from $10 to $100 and shows the fill-down feature for the formula; cell B2 has the equation =0.18*A2 and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.    Next, we can drag our formula down and the cell reference will change to each row number automatically.  Here are the formulas with the row numbers updated:    This spreadsheet shows the result of filling down the formula. The cell reference changes for each new row.    Here is our completed table with the calculations:    This spreadsheet shows the calculated values for tips from $10-100.      Formulas  Spreadsheets have many useful built-in formulas. We will introduce some of the financial formulas in this chapter. Here are some of the formulas we will use:    =FV to calculate the future values of an investment     =PV to calculate the deposit needed for a desired future balance     =PMT to calculate a loan or savings plan payment     =EFFECT to calculate the effective rate of an account and compare accounts     In the rest of this chapter we will examine the mathematics behind these formulas and their applications in personal finance.    Exercises   Use a spreadsheet to complete the following exercises.    Add 8 and 19.    =8+19 which gives 27    Find the difference of 230 and 78.    =230-78 which gives 152    Multiply 12 and 9.    =12*9 which gives 108    Divide 0.09 by 52.    =0.09\/52 which gives approximately 0.001731    Calculate .    =8^3 which gives 512    Your bill at a restaurant is $55.75 and you want to leave a 20% tip. How much would you add to the bill?    =55.75*20% which gives $11.15    You leave a tip for $7.50 for a bill at a restaurant that is $44.50. What percent tip did you leave?    =7.50\/44.50 which gives approximately 0.1685, or approximately 16.85%    In Column A use the fill down feature to build a spreadsheet starting with $5 and ending at $125, in increments of $5. In Column B write a formula with a cell reference to calculate a 15.5% tip on the amount in Column A. Use the fill down feature to complete your table.   See the table below:  Note, the entry in cell B1 is =15%*A1 . (Columns A and B are given dollar formatting.)    A portion of a spreadsheet is shown which includes cells A1 through B25, and with a title heading of Table 1. Cell A1 shows $5.00, cell A2 shows $10.00, and so on. The pattern shows that each additional cell under A1 is equal to the cell above it, plus $5.00. This pattern continues down to cell A25, which shows $125.00. Cell B1 shows $0.78, which is 15% of the $5.00 amount shown in cell A1. Cell B2 shows $1.55, which is 15% of the $10.00 amount shown in cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell B25, which shows $19.38, and which is 15% of the $125.00 amount shown in cell A25.      Imagine a certain savings account started out with a balance of $5250.00 on day-one, and today has a current balance of $5780.23.     Exactly how much more money does the account have today, compared with day-one?    Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent: By what percentage amount has the account balance grown?    If instead, the bank balance today was exactly double the starting balance, then by what exact percentage amount would the bank balance have grown?    If the bank balance today had instead grown by 15.5% since day-one, then what would be the exact amount of today's balance?          =5780.23-5250 which gives $530.23     =530.23\/5250 which gives approximately 0.100996, or approximately 10.1%    Exactly 200%     =5250*115.5% which gives exactly $6063.75       Imagine that at the start of a certain month, you will make an opening deposit of $500 into a savings account, and you will then leave the account alone (meaning you will make no further deposits or withdrawals). Also, for this account: Every month after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 101% of its previous month's balance.     Use a spreadsheet to enter 500 in cell A1. Using a formula and a cell-reference: Compute in cell A2, the amount in the account after one month has passed. Then using the fill down feature, continue the pattern for another eleven full months (you should end at cell A13). Format all the cells to show dollar signs. What is the amount in the account after one year?    Now continue the pattern in column A of your spreadsheet to extend for a second full year (you should end at cell A25). What is the amount in the account after two years?    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the opening deposit and one year later? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the end of year one, and the end of year two? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    (Challenge) The annual percentage growth that you found in part (d) for the second year, should be identical to the annual percentage growth that you found in part (c) for the first year. Can you mathematically explain why this is true? Do you think this pattern of identical overall annual percentage growth would continue, if you extend the pattern for even more years?         See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 1 year, the account holds $563.41.    See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 2 years, the account holds $634.87.     =A13\/A1 which gives growth     =A25\/A13 which gives growth (same)    Each starting value increases mathematically by a factor of each year, which is approximately 112.6825%. So yes, this pattern must continue indefinitely into future years.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown covering cells A1 through A25, and with a title heading of Table 2. Cell A1 shows $500.00. Cell A2 shows $505.00, which is 101% of cell A1. Cell A3 shows $510.05, which is 101% of cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell A25, which shows $634.87, and which is 101% of cell A24.      Imagine that at the start of a certain year, you will deposit $1000.00 into a savings account, and then you will leave the account alone. Each year after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 103% of its previous year's balance.     After two years, the account balance will have experienced two growth amounts of 103%. You can find this account balance amount here, with the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%) * (103%) . Perform this computation in a spreadsheet and write the balance that you find.    Now enter the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%)^2 . Notice that the result here, which involves using a power, gives the same answer as you found in part (a). Comparing the two spreadsheet computations: Explain why they give the same result.    Using the pattern in part (b) above, and carefully choosing the power: Compute the balance that will be in the account fifteen full years after the account was originally opened. (Round to the nearest cent)    (Challenge) Make a spreadsheet that shows the account balance each individual year for 30 years. From the date of the opening deposit: What minimum number of full years will you have to wait, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount? (Use cell references, the fill down feature, and dollar formatting)    (Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)? Do you think your answer would be the same here, for any positive opening balance you may choose for the account?          =1000*103%*103% which gives $1060.90     =1000*(103%)^2 gives the same result of $1060.90, because raising 103% to the second power means the same as multiplying 103% by itself two times.     =1000*(103%)^15 which gives $1557.97 rounded to the nearest cent    Refer to the table at the bottom for part d and part e.  Note the entry in cell B3 here is = B2*103% and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down feature.  You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed twice the opening deposit amount.    Since , the minimum number of full years until the opening deposit doubles must be the same here, for any positive opening balance that we may choose for this account.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown, which includes cells A1 through E32, and with a title heading of Table 3. Cell A1 shows a column title of Year, and cells A2 through A32 contain values of 0 through 30, respectively. Cells D1 through D32 are a copy of cells A1 through A32. Cell B1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $1,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell A1. Cell B3 shows $1,030.00, which is 103% of the $1,000 shown in cell B2. Cell B4 shows $1,060.90, which is 103% of the $1,030.00 shown in cell B3. This pattern continues until we get to cell B32, which shows $2,427.26, and which is 103% of the $2,356.57 amount shown in cell B31. Cell E1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $5,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell D1. Cell E3 shows $5,150.00, which is 103% of the $5,000 shown in cell E2. Cell E4 shows $5,304.50, which is 103% of the $5,150.00 shown in cell E3. This pattern continues until we get to cell E32, which shows $12,136.31, and which is 103% of the $11,782.83 amount shown in cell E31.      "

Each year after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 103% of its previous year's balance.     After two years, the account balance will have experienced two growth amounts of 103%. You can find this account balance amount here, with the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%) * (103%) . Perform this computation in a spreadsheet and write the balance that you find.    Now enter the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%)^2 . Notice that the result here, which involves using a power, gives the same answer as you found in part (a). Comparing the two spreadsheet computations: Explain why they give the same result.    Using the pattern in part (b) above, and carefully choosing the power: Compute the balance that will be in the account fifteen full years after the account was originally opened. (Round to the nearest cent)    (Challenge) Make a spreadsheet that shows the account balance each individual year for 30 years. From the date of the opening deposit: What minimum number of full years will you have to wait, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount? (Use cell references, the fill down feature, and dollar formatting)    (Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)?

Note the entry in cell B3 here is = B2*103% and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down feature.  You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed twice the opening deposit amount.

  "body": " Simple Interest    Students will be able to     Calculate interest and future values in simple interest applications.    Find present value and interest rates in simple interest appliations.    Calculate the interest and principle portions of amortized loan payments.      Simple Interest  Interest is the term used for the fee charged to borrow money in a loan or the return on a savings account or other investment. Simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the starting amount of the loan or investment.  For example, suppose a college student borrowed $2,000 from their sibling to pay for tuition. They will pay it back after one year with 3% interest. The amount of interest charged will be 3% of $2,000, or . At the end of the year, the student should pay their sibling the $2,000 borrowed plus $60 in interest.  Interest rates are most-commonly given as annual rates. So, if this student were to repay the money after 3 years, they would owe in interest. If they were to repay the money after 6 months, which is half of a year, they would owe in interest.  We can generalize to obtain the simple interest formula:   Simple Interest Formula   where    is the interest , which is a dollar amount     is the principal , or starting amount in dollars, also called present value , and     is the annual (yearly) interest rate , which is a percentage expressed in decimal form    t  is the time in years   If the amount of time is given in days, weeks, or months, remember to convert to years before using the formula.     Francesca invested $10,000 in a one-month certificate of deposit account with an annual interest rate of 7%. How much interest will Francesca earn? What will the value of the account be at maturity?    First, we convert 1 month to years to find .  Now we can use the simple interest formula with , , and , rounding to the nearest cent.     Therefore, Francesca will earn $58.33 in interest, and the value of the account at maturity will be .    We use the term future value to refer to the total value of an account at maturity or the total amount repaid at the end of a simple interest loan. It is the sum of the principal (or present value) and the interest. We typically denote it with the variable for amount.   Simple Interest Future Value  Future value can be found using any of these equivalent formulas: where is the interest amount, is the principal or present value, is the interest rate in decimal form, and is the time in years.     Find the future value of $817 invested at 4.625% simple interest for 8 years.    Using  To apply the formula , we must first calculate the interest using the principal , interest rate , and time .   Now we add the principal and interest to find the future value.   Therefore, the future value is $1,119.29.    Using  The principal is , the interest rate , and the time .  Substituting these values into the formula, we obtain the future value in one step.   Therefore, the future value is $1,119.29.    Using  The principal is , the interest rate , and the time .  Substituting these values into the formula, we obtain the future value in one step.   Therefore, the future value is $1,119.29.     Which simple interest future value formula should I use? For the most part, you may use any of the three formulas. However, there are some situations where you can make your work easier by selecting the appropriate formula:     Use if you do not know the interest rate or the time.    Use if you are solving for the interest rate or the time.    Use if you are solving for the present value. This formula will be used to derive the compound interest formula in .       If $275 is invested into an account that earns 7% simple interest, how long will it take for the value to double?          APR – Annual Percentage Rate  Interest rates are usually stated as an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest that will be paid in the year. If not stated otherwise, assume that the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods.  Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR which includes the interest and any fees included.  For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is half a percent per month.     A 4% annual rate paid quarterly, would be divided by 4 to get 1% per quarter.     Here is an example of a semi-annual rate.    Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?     , the principal   , interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), so the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.   , 4 years compounded twice a year gives half-years     You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is     We could also use a spreadsheet to do this calculation and enter:   =1000+1000*(0.04\/2)*(4*2)   which also gives $1,160. The future value of the bond is $1,160. Remember that spreadsheets don't interpret parentheses as multiplication. We need the asterisks as well as the parentheses.     "

  "title": "Credit Cards",
  "body": " Credit Cards   Credit cards are a common source of debt. The Federal Reserve Bank reported that in the second quarter of 2024, Americans owed $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, which is an average of about $4,400 per adult. In this section, we will investigate how credit cards work with the goal of empowering readers to make educated financial decisions about these accounts.     Students will be able to:     Identify rates and fees in the \"fine print\" of credit card agreements.    Calculate average daily balance.    Calculate credit card finance charges using the average daily balance method and the daily balance method.    Analyze credit card terms to identify the best options for different types of consumers.      What is a Credit Card?  A credit cards is a form of revolving debt. With most loans, such as mortgages or car loans, the money is borrowed all at once and paid back with interest over time. With credit cards, borrowers use the card to make purchases, and they pay back some or all of the amount borrowed each month, and this cycle of borrowing and making payments continues until the account is closed.   Diagram of three monthly billing cycles of a credit card.   Three monthly payments are diagrammed, showing the monthly billing statement generated at the end of each monthly cycle and due 21-25 days into the subsequent cycle. Each bill includes the total spending from the current month, any remaining unpaid balance from the previous month, and a finance charge on the previous month.    Credit card accounts are unique in that if the borrower pays the entire statement balance each month, there is no interest charged on purchases made using the card. Further, many cards offer rewards to the consumer in the form of cash back, points or miles in rewards programs, or even reducing the balance of a home loan! On the other hand, the if the borrower is unable to pay the entire statement balance each month, they begin to accrue finance charges, which are calculated using the simple interest formula. The interest rates on credit card accounts tend to be significantly higher than those for other types of loans, so borrowers can find themselves amassing a large amount of debt quite quickly.    Credit Card Balances and Finance Charges  The balance in an account typically means the amount of money currently held in that account, whether it is a debt or an investment. With credit cards, the amount owed changes frequently and fees are accrued over time but applied once. As such, there are several different types of balance:   Types of Balances      Previous Balance: the amount of debt carried over from the previous month.     Ending Balance: the amount owed at the end of a billing cycle before finance charges or other fees have been applied.     Statement Balance or New Balance: the total amount shown on the billing statement. It is the sum of the ending balance and any finance charges or fees that are applied at the end of the billing cycle.     Daily Balance or Current Balance: the total balance at a given time. The current balance incorporates any unpaid debt carried over from the previous billing cycle and any activity (purchases, payments, etc.) that have been posted to the account.     Payoff Balance: the total amount a consumer would have to pay to close out the account. It is the sum of the current balance and any prorated finance charges that have accumulated but not yet been applied. (A prorated finance charge is also called residual interest.)     Average Daily Balance: the average of the current balances on each day of a billing cycle.      A finance charge is the interest charged on the amount owed. It is calculated as the simple interest on the balance on the account. However, there are several ways this can be done. Most credit card accounts use either the average daily balance and apply finance charges monthly or they use the the daily balance and apply finance charges daily. Each credit card agreement will indicate which method is used.   Finance Charge Calculation using Average Daily Balance   Suppose the average daily balance on a credit card account is $5,224.27. Calculalate the finance charge for a 30-day month if the annual percentage rate (APR) is 11.5% and the charge is calculated using each method.   Based on the number of days in the billing period.    Based on one month as one twelfth of a year.       The APR is the annual interest rate, , and the finance charge is the interest, , on the balance, , for the given amount of time.     If the finance charge is based on the number of days in the billing period, then the amount of time in years is . Therefore, the finance charge is calculated as follows. The finance charge is rounded to the nearest cent.  An alternative approach is to convert the annual percentage rate to a daily rate ; then multiply the balance by the daily rate times the number of days. This results in the equivalent calculation     If the finance charge is based on just one month, each month is considered one twelfth of a year regardless of how many days it contains. Therefore, we will use .   An alternative approach is to convert the annual percentage rate to a monthly rate ; then multiply the balance by the monthly rate times the number of months, which is one. This results in the equivalent calculation         Average Daily Balance Method With Time Measured in Days   A credit card billing period runs from January 23 to February 22. The previous balance is $1,234 and the transactions are listed below.    Date  Description  Charge\/Credit    Jan 27  Mathematical Hardware  $314    Jan 30  Payment Thank You  $1,000 (cr)    Feb 4  Not Great Clothing (Returns)  $192 (cr)    Feb 12  Yummy Chocolate  $30    Feb 14  Fancy Restaurant  $120    Suppose this credit card uses the average daily balance method and charges an annual interest rate of 19.6%. We will find the ending balance, the average daily balance, the finance charge, and the total balance after the finance charge is applied. For calculating the finance charge, this account measures time in days.    To find the ending balance , starting with the previous balance, we add the charges and subtract the credits. Therefore, the ending balance is $386.  To find the average daily balance , we first find the balance at the end of each day. Then we find the average of the daily balances. It can be helpful to write the balances in a calendar or grid.   Jan 23-26: $1234, Jan 27-29: $1548, Jan 30-Feb 3: $548, Feb 4-11: $356, Feb 12-13: $386, Feb 14-22: $506   Now we can find the average of the balances in each day of the cycle. We will use multiplication for the repeated addition, and we note that there are 31 days in the billing cycle.   Alternatively, a spreadsheet can be used.  The finance charge is 31 days simple interest on the average daily balance at 19.6%. Therefore, the finance charge will be $10.98.  Alternatively, the annual percentage rate (APR) of 19.6% can be converted to a daily rate of and multiplied by the number of days. The resulting finance charge calculation results in the same value:   To find the total amount owed, we add the ending balance and the finance charge to obtain .      Credit Card Agreements: Reading the Fine Print  A credit card agreement describes the policies and rates which apply to the account. It should contain a table summarizing the interest rates and fees. An example is provided below.   Sample excerpt from a credit card account agreement. A screenreader accessible version is available.  Use the link in the caption for a screenreader accessible version of the table in a Microsoft Word document.   The For consumers who routinely pay the whole statement balance each month, the APR is of little importance.     In general, how can credit-card users avoid finance charges?   Credit card users can avoid finance charges by routinely paying their entire balance by the due date.    What are the two most commonly used methods of calculating balances that will be used for finance charges?   The two most common methods are the daily balance method and the average daily balance method.    "

The finance charge is 31 days simple interest on the average daily balance at 19.6%. Therefore, the finance charge will be $10.98.  Alternatively, the annual percentage rate (APR) of 19.6% can be converted to a daily rate of and multiplied by the number of days. The resulting finance charge calculation results in the same value:   To find the total amount owed, we add the ending balance and the finance charge to obtain .   "

  "body": " Compound Interest     Introduction to Compound Interest  In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding . We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.  Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?  The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn per month.  In the first month,     In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.  In the second month,     Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.  Calculating out a few more months in a table or a spreadsheet we have:    Month  Starting balance  Interest earned  Ending Balance    1  1000.00  2.50  1002.50    2  1002.50  2.51  1005.01    3  1005.01  2.51  1007.52    4  1007.52  2.52  1010.04    5  1010.04  2.53  1012.57    6  1012.57  2.53  1015.10    7  1015.10  2.54  1017.64    8  1017.64  2.54  1020.18    9  1020.18  2.55  1022.73    10  1022.73  2.56  1025.29    11  1025.29  2.56  1027.85    12  1027.85  2.56  1030.42     About Rounding  When completing the table above, we rounded each interest amount to the nearest cent and used the rounded value in subsequent calculations. This is how banking institutions calculate and apply or charge interest.  Next in this section, we will develop and use a formula to calculate future value in one step without making a table. Using this formula bypasses the intermediate rounding steps and can result in values that may be slightly different from the correct value. Don't worry: the results typically are off by a few cents at most, so using the formula provides a highly efficient way to make long-term predictions.  Since banks use mathematical formulas to calculate loan payments, these small differences affect us in \"real life\", too! If you or someone you know is paying off a loan, the bank may have adjusted the payment size by a few cents to account for rounding.   To find an equation to calculate future balances more efficiently, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:  Initial Amount:               Observing a pattern, we could conclude     If we wanted to calculate the balance after 15 years, we observe that 15 years is equal to months. This results in   Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. This approach is generalized to the formula that follows.   Compound Interest        A  is the future value balance in the account after years    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years     Note that the exponent is equal to the total number of periods.   If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, .  If the compounding is done weekly, .  If the compounding is done daily, .  The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.    Applications of the Compound Interest Formula   Finding a Future Value   A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% APR, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?   , the initial deposit   , 6% annual rate   , 12 months in 1 year   , since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years     Therefore, we will end up with approximately $9,930.61 after 20 years.    The calculation in the example above also can be done using the future value formula on a spreadsheet. The format is as follows: =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value) where the rate per period is , the number of periods is , and the present value is the principal . In this section, we only deal with one-time investments, so the payment amount will be $0.  In the exercise, we would type =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 0, 3000)   and get a result of $9,930.61, rounded to the nearest cent.    Comparing Simple and Compound Interest  Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.      Year  Simple Interest ($15 per month)  Compound Interest (6% compounded monthly or 0.5% each month    0  $3,000  $3,000    5  $3,900  $4,046.55    10  $4,800  $5,458.19    15  $5,700  $7,362.28    20  $6,600  $9,930.61    25  $7,500  $13,394.91    30  $8,400  $18,067.73    35  $9,300  $24,370.65     A coordinate graph with years on the x-axis and account balance on the y-axis. The simple interest increases in a straight line; the compound interest curves up faster because it is an exponential function.      Finding the Principal, or Present Value  When we know the amount of money we want to have in the future, we can use the formula that is solved for P . It requires a little algebra to divide both sides of the formula by the quantity that was multiplied by P . There is also a spreadsheet formula which we will introduce now, and then do an example using both methods.    The Present Value Spreadsheet Formula  The present value spreadsheet formula will calculate how much you need to deposit in the present to get a specified future value.   Present Value Spreadsheet Formula   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     future value  is the amount desired in the future,         You know that you will need $40,000 for your child's education in 18 years. If your account earns 4% APR compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your goal?    We are looking for what we need to deposit now so we will use the present value formula. We type the formula and inputs the same way we used the future value formula.   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)    =PV(0.04\/4, 4*18, 0, 40000)   which gives a value of $19,539.84. You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now and keep the same interest rate to have $40,000 in 18 years.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that we cannot enter commas in numbers in a spreadsheet. Commas are used to separate the input values, so we would not get the same answer if we put in $40,000 for an input.  To use the mathematical formula, we use the one that is solved for P .   , 4% APR   , 4 quarters in 1 year   , since we know the balance in 18 years   , the amount we have in 18 years  In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for P.     You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now to have $40,000 in 18 years.      Continuously Compounded Interest  In many bank accounts your interest is compounded continuously, or at each moment in time. The number of times per year, n, is infinite. As n approaches infinity the compound interest formula changes to the continuously compounded interest formula.   Continuously Compounded Interest        A  is the future value or desired balance in the account    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    t  is the number of years    e  is an irrational number that is approximately 2.718281828… Find on your calculator to use this formula     To calculate this on a spreadsheet we use the =EXP function. The spreadsheet formulas are   =Principal*EXP(r*t) or =A\/EXP(r*t)      You deposit $4000 in an account that earns 2.75% APR compounded continuously. How much will you have after 7 years? How much interest did you earn? What percentage of the final balance is interest?      To use a spreadsheet, we look at the formula solved for A, the future value. We enter   =4000*EXP(0.0275*7)   and get a result of $4,849.11.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:      , amount invested   , interest rate   , number of years     After 7 years your account would be worth $4,849.11. Next, we will calculate the amount of interest earned and the percentage.      Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage  In the previous example we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $4,849.11. Now to figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.   Continued: To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.     The spreadsheet calculation is   =4849.11-4000   which gives a result of $849.11. You would earn $849.11 in interest.  To find the percentage that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount.     The spreadsheet calculation is the same:   =849.11\/4849.11   which is 0.1751 or 17.5%. This tells us that after 7 years, 17.5% of the account was earned as interest.     Effective Rate  If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called =EFFECT which will allow us to compare accounts. This is also sometimes called the annual percentage yield, or APY.   Effective Rate Formula   =EFFECT(stated rate, number of compounding periods)      stated rate  is the interest rate given (APR)    number of compounding periods  is the number of times the account is compounded per year,         You are comparing an account that pays 5.25% APR compounded monthly, with an account that pays 5% APR compounded daily. Which account will earn you more interest?    It is hard to tell whether the higher interest rate will be better or the higher compounding rate in this case. We will find the effective rate of both accounts.  For the 5.25% APR account compounded monthly:     =EFFECT(0.0525,12)   which gives 0.05378 or 5.38%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05,365)   which gives 0.05127 or 5.13%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now we can compare the effective rates of 5.38% and 5.13% and see that the account with the higher interest rate will earn more interest in this case. This is not always true, so we will show another example.      Find the effective rates to compare an account that earns 6% APR compounded quarterly with an account that earns 5.975% APR compounded daily. Which one would you choose?    Using the effective rate formula for each, we have:  For the 6% APR account compounded quarterly:     =EFFECT(0.06,4)   which gives 0.06136 or 6.14%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5.975% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05975,365)   which gives 0.06157 or 6.16%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    The account that was compounded more often has a slightly higher rate in this case.      Exercises   A friend lends you $200 for a week, which you agree to repay with 5% one-time interest. How much will you have to repay?      You will have to repay $210.    You loan your friend $100. They agree to pay an annual interest rate of 3%, simple interest. Six months later they repay that loan.   How much did they pay you?    How much was interest?                    They paid $101.50 total, $1.50 was interest.    Consider a simple interest loan of $200 with an annual interest rate of 6%. If that loan is paid off 1 year and 3 months later, how much was repaid?      $215 was repaid.    You deposit $1,000 in an account that earns simple interest. The annual interest rate is 2.5%.     How much interest will you earn in 5 years?    How much will you have in the account in 5 years?                  The interest earned was $125. This brings the account balance to $1,125.    Consider an investment of $20000 with an annual interest rate of 5%.   If that investment is earning simple interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?    If that investment is getting annually compounding interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?                    The simple interest account would be worth $30,000 and the account that was compounding would be worth $32,577.89 in ten years.    Nico invests $4,500 into an account that has an annual interest rate of 8.5%. The interest is compounding monthly. Twenty years later what is the account balance?

  "body": " The Statistical Process    Students will be able to:     Define and identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic    Identify four sampling methods: simple random sample (SRS), stratified, systematic and convenience    Identify and discuss types of bias association with sampling    Distinguish between experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies    Explain margin of error and confidence intervals      Statistical Process  To give you an overview, here is a diagram of the steps taken in a poll or other statistical study, and the elements in each step that we will discuss in this chapter. We will use many examples to illustrate the whole process.    5 rectangles indicating the 5 steps of the statistical process; 1. Identify the group you want to study, which is the population; 2. Identify the quantity you want to know about the population, which is the parameter; 3. Gather data by taking an unbiased sample or performing an experiment; 4. Graph the data and calculate statistics; 5. Estimate the parameter that you wanted to know with the margin of error and confidence interval.      Population  Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The population could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.  If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Portland Community College. Or it might be:   All community college students in the state of Oregon.    All students at public colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.    And so on.     The intended population is also called the target population , since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.    A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?    While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.      Parameter  A parameter is the value (percentage, average, etc.) that we are interested in for the whole population. Since it is often too time-consuming, expensive and\/or impossible to get data for the entire population, the parameter is usually a theoretical quantity that we are trying to estimate. For example, the typical amount of money spent per year on textbooks by students at your college in a year is a parameter.    Sample  To estimate the parameter, we select a sample , which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a representative sample , one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at your college, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.    Statistic  To get our data , we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or raw data . Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A statistic is a value (percentage, average, etc.) calculated using data from a sample.    A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Portland feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to the Pioneer Place Mall and survey 500 shoppers. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic.     Population : While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that shoppers at this mall would be representative of all Portland citizens.   Parameter : The parameter is what we want to know about the population, the percentage of Portland citizens that support the initiative.   Sample : The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 shoppers questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.   Statistic : The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.      Sampling  As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support they have among the electorate should they decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Eligible voters might be better, but what if they don't register? Registered voters may not vote. What about likely voters?   This is the criteria used in a lot of political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a likely voter.  Here is an example of the challenges of political polling.   In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.   So, identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we choose a good sample? We want our statistic to estimate the parameter we are interested in, so we need to have a representative sample. Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we drew all of our samples from customers at a Starbucks, or your list of TikTok followers. How do we get a sample that resembles our population?    Sampling Methods  One way to get a representative sample is to use randomness. We will look at three types of sampling that use randomness and one that does not.    Simple random sample (SRS)  A simple random sample , abbreviated SRS, is one in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen.   If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random sample.   In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor. It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Oregon, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. This is called sampling variation . If there are certain groups that we want to make sure are represented, we might instead use a stratified sample.    Stratified sampling  In stratified sampling , a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup. It is often desirable to make the sample sizes proportional to the size of each subgroup in the population.   Suppose that data from voter registrations in the state indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% Independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 Independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.   A way to remember stratified sampling is think about having a piece of layer cake. Each layer represents a stratum or subgroup, and a slice of the cake represents a sample of each layer.    Systematic sampling  In systematic sampling , every member of the population is selected to be in the sample. The starting position is often chosen at random.   To select a systematic sample, Portland Community College could use their database to select a random student from the first 100 student ID numbers. Then they would select every 100th student ID number after that. Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your ID number is right next to your friend's because you applied at the same time, you could not both end up in the same sample) but it can yield acceptable samples. This method can be useful for people waiting in lines, parts on a manufacturing line, or plants in a row.     Convenience sampling   Convenience sampling is when samples are chosen by selecting whomever is convenient. This is the worst type of sampling because it does not use randomness.   A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to them. This is a convenience sample.     Statistical Bias  There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is very important to think through the entire study and data analysis before we start. We talked about sampling or selection bias , which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is voluntary response bias , which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate. This can lead to bias if the people who volunteer have different characteristics than the general population. Here is a summary of some additional sources of bias.    Types of bias   Sampling bias – when the sample is not representative of the population   Voluntary response bias – the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is made up of volunteers   Self-interest study – bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome   Response bias – when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason   Perceived lack of anonymity – when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively affect them   Loaded questions – when the question wording influences the responses   Non-response bias – when people refuse to participate in a study or drop out of an experiment, we can no longer be certain that our sample is representative of the population  Sources of bias may be conscious or unconscious. They may be innocent or as intentional as pressuring by a pollster. Here are some examples of the types of bias.      Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers Reuters. . Retrieved 4\/27\/09 . This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.      Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question wording. Also of concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. Here is an example from a psychology researcher Swartz, Norbert. Retrieved 3\/31\/2009 :    My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.      Observational Studies  So far, we have primarily discussed surveys and polls, which are types of observational studies – studies based on observations or measurements. These observations may be solicited, like in a survey or poll. Or, they may be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a no turn on red sign.  As a general rule, there is no impactful change or intervention involved in an observational study. So a study that compares the pass rates of all the sections of Math in Society at a given college for three quarters is observational. However, a study that compares the pass rates of all sections of Math in Society before and after switching to a new textbook would not be observational because it is testing for differences that might be due to the intervention of using a different book. (It would be quasi-experimental, which is described later in this section.)    Experiments  In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence. In an experiment, some kind of treatment is applied to the subjects and the results are measured and recorded. When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested, meaning that there must be both a treatment group that receives the treatment and a control group that does not recieve the treatment so that the results can be compared. Assignment to the treatment group and the control group must be random. Here are some examples of treatments.      A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.    A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.    A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on affect by measuring people's mood while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.    Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the state's standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.  The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.        Quasi-Experiments  A quasi-experiment is a study intended to assess the effects of a treatment or intervention but does not have random assignment to the treatment and control groups. There are three main types of quasi-experimental studies:    Pre-post intervention study: data are gathered before and after an intervention is applied. This is commonly used in medicine and education. For example, a psychologist may ask patients to assess their sense of self-worth before and after undergoing talk therapy. A form of pre-post intervention study design in which data is gathered multiple times before and after the intervention is often referred to as interrupted time series design.     Nonequivalent groups: a treatment or intervention is applied to a control group that is not randomly selected or may have additional differences beyond the intervention being studied. For example, a college that offers four sections of a class may assign a teaching assistant to two of the sections to determine if students learn better with a teaching assistant in the class. Since students were not randomly assigned to the class, they may not be representative of the same student populations. Further, if the sections have different instructors with different teaching styles, there will be additional differences in the experinces for the students.     Natural experiment: a natural experiment occurs when a researcher studies the impacts of an intervention that was not made or done by the researcher. For example, if a state enacts new stricter gun laws, researchers can study violent crime rates before and after the laws are enacted. They also might compare these rates with those of other states that did not enact similar laws.       Confounding   Confounding occurs when there are two or more potential variables that could have caused the outcome and it is not possible to determine which one actually caused the result.      A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8 pounds while using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying that participants were encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether the weight loss is due to the pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case confounding has occurred.    Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an arithmetic test if they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without music, then give a similar test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student might perform better on the second test, regardless of the music, simply because it was the second test and they were warmed up.      There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of confounding. The primary measure is to use a control group.    Control group  In experiments, the participants are typically divided into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group receives the treatment being tested; the control group does not receive the treatment.  Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only potential source of difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing groups is important. Some researchers attempt to ensure that the groups have similar characteristics (same number of each gender identity, same number of people over 50, etc.), but it is nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random assignment is very commonly used.      To determine if a two-day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a two-day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups took the SAT test.    A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields that typically produce the same amount of food. The treatment group receives the new plant food and the control group does not. The crop yields would then be compared. By growing the two crops at the same time in similar fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.      Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for confounding variables. For example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill by giving the treatment group the pill and the control group nothing. If the treatment group showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the medicine, or a response to have something. This is called a placebo effect.    Placebo effect  The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the patient's perception of how effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.   A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were receiving a strong painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much pain relief as patients receiving a dose of morphine. Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL. (1981) Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in individuals with postoperative pain. Pain. 10:379-89.    To control for the placebo effect, a placebo , or dummy treatment, is often given to the control group. This way, both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment given.    Placebo and Placebo-controlled experiments  An experiment that gives the control group a placebo is called a placebo-controlled experiment.      In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used as a placebo.    In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to the control group as a placebo.    In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food, and the control group could be given standard frozen meals taken out of their original packaging.      In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo. For example, in a cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the control group or to give a placebo treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine would be given to the second group, called a comparison group . In our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be encouraged to study on their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison. It is very important to consider the ethical ramifications of any experiment.    Blind studies  A blind study is one that uses a placebo and the participants do not know whether they are receiving the treatment or a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which the subjects and those interacting with them don't know who is in the treatment group and who is in the control group.   In a study about anti-depression medication, you would not want the psychological evaluator to know whether a patient is in the treatment or control group, as it might influence their evaluation. The experiment should be conducted as a double-blind study.     Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals  Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn't expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.  You've probably heard something like, The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent. The 3% is called the margin of error , so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a confidence interval , we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).  The most common confidence level is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times. You can learn more on how to calculate the margin of error for different confidence levels in a statistics class.    Let's say we asked a random sample of 100 students at Portland Community College and found that they spent an average of $451.32 on books their first year, plus or minus $85.63. Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).  Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.      Exercises   Describe the difference between a sample and a population.   A sample is a sub group of the population. A population is the entire group of subjects.    Describe the difference between a statistic and a parameter.   A Statistic is a measurement obtained from the data taken from a sample. A parameter is a measurement obtained from the data of the entire population.    The ASPCC randomly selects 200 students from PCC Cascade campus to participate in a childcare survey in order to determine the demand for additional childcare options for PCC students.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?      The intended population is all PCC students.   All PCC Students    200 students from PCC Cascade campus    The collected data is not representative of all PCC students since it only includes responses from students at Cascade campus. This is an example of sampling bias.       A local research firm randomly selects 1200 homes in Washington County to determine support for adding compost pick up to residents' regular garbage service.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?         The intended population is all Washington County residences.    1200 homes in Washington County    The collected data is likely representative since residences were selected at random from the entire county.       A political scientist surveys 28 of the current 106 representatives in a state's congress. Of them, 14 said they were supporting a new education bill, 12 said there were not supporting the bill, and 2 were undecided.     Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of representatives surveyed who said they were supporting the education bill.    If the margin of error was 5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of representatives we might we expect to support the education bill and explain what the confidence interval tells us.

The population size is     The sample size is in     The statistic is or 50%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of the state congress representatives in support of the new education (the parameter) likely lies between 45% and 55%.       The city of Raleigh has 9,500 registered voters. There are two candidates for city council in an upcoming election: Brown and Feliz.

Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of voters surveyed who said they'd vote for Brown.    If the margin of error was 3.5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of voters surveyed that we might we expect to vote for Brown and explain what the confidence interval tells us.         All registered voters in the city of Raleigh.    The population size is     The sample size is     The statistic is or 32%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of registered voters who will vote for Brown is likely to lie between 28.5% and 35.5%.

Observational: Survey adults who played sports as a child. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Record the percentage of each personality type.  Experimental: Survey adults and ask them if they played sports as children. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Compare the results of adults who played sports as children with the adults who didn't play sports as children.  Which is more practical? The Experimental study would allow you to see if there is a significant difference in the personality types based on if the person played sports or didn't play sports.    Find a newspaper or magazine article, or the online equivalent, describing the results of a recent study (not a simple poll). Give a summary of the study's findings, then analyze whether the article provided enough information to determine the validity of the conclusions. If not, produce a list of things that are missing from the article that would help you determine the validity of the study. Look for the things discussed in the text: population, sample, randomness, blind, control, margin of error, etc.   Answers will vary depending on the article.    Use a polling website such as or and search for a poll that interests you. Find the result, the margin of error and confidence level for the poll and write the confidence interval.   Answers will vary depending on the poll being studied.    "

Population : While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that shoppers at this mall would be representative of all Portland citizens.   Parameter : The parameter is what we want to know about the population, the percentage of Portland citizens that support the initiative.   Sample : The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 shoppers questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.

  "body": " In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.

This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.     "

  "body": " Describing Data    Students will be able to:     Define and identify categorical and quantitative data    Read and construct frequency tables and relative frequency tables    Make bar charts and pie charts for categorical variables by hand and\/or using technology    Identify elements of misleading graphs: 3-dimensional graphs, perceptual distortion, misleading scales, stacked bar graphs    Make histograms for quantitative variables by hand and\/or using technology    Identify the number of modes in a distribution and whether it is symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right      Once we have collected data from an observational study or an experiment, we need to summarize and present it in a way that will be meaningful to our audience. The raw data is not very useful by itself. In this section we will begin with graphical presentations of data and in the rest of the chapter we will learn about numerical summaries of data.    Types of Data  There are two types of data, categorical data and quantitative data. The word data is plural because it represents many pieces of information.   Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the subjects into various categories.   We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that people saw in a movie theater. When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, Black Panther, Titanic, etc.   We can count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like Black Panther because it is categorical data.    Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful calculations.   A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). This would be quantitative data.   Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 110 minutes, etc.) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $9.75, $10.50, etc.).  We cannot assume that all numbers are quantitative data, and sometimes it is not so clear-cut. Here are some examples to illustrate this.      Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is \"twice\" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is \"twice\" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.    A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.   Overall, it is important to look at the purpose of the study for any variables that could be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Another consideration is what you plan to do with the data. Next, we will talk about how to display each type of data.    Presenting Categorical Data  Since we can't do calculations with categorical data, we begin by summarizing the data in a frequency table or a relative frequency table.    Frequency Tables  A frequency table has one column for the categories, and another for the frequency , or number of times that category occurred.   An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors. If a person is considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is the color of your car. The insurance company believes that people with some color cars are more likely to get in accidents. To research this, they examine police reports for recent total-loss collisions. The data is summarized in this table.    Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions    Blue  25    Green  52    Red  41    White  36    Black  39    Grey  23    Total  216       Relative Frequency Tables  Counts are usually not as easy to interpret as percentages, so we will add a column for the relative frequencies. A relative frequency is the percentage for the category, found by dividing each frequency by the total and converting to a percentage. You'll notice the percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.     Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions  Relative Frequency of Total-Loss Collisions    Blue  25  or 11.6%    Green  52  or 24.1%    Red  41  or 19.0%    White  36  or 16.7%    Black  39  or 18.1%    Grey  23  or 10.7%    Total  216  or 100%    It would be even more useful to have a visual to see what is going on, and this is where charts and graphs come in. For categorical data we can display our data using bar graphs and pie charts.     Bar graphs  A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the height of the bar indicating the frequency of that category. To construct a bar graph with vertical bars, we label the horizontal axis with the categories. The vertical axis will have a scale for the frequency or relative frequency.   The highest frequency in our car data is 52 collisions, so we will set our vertical axis to go from 0 to 55, with a scale of 5 units. To draw bar graphs by hand graph paper is useful, or you can use technology. It is also very helpful to label each bar with the frequency or relative frequency.   This is a bar graph. Along the x-axis it lists: blue, green, red, white, black and grey. The x-axis is labeled “Vehicle color involved in total-loss collision.” The y-axis is labeled “frequency” and goes from 0 to 55 with a scale of 5. Above each color there is a bar corresponding to the frequency. Blue 25; Green 52; Red 41; White 36; Black 39; Grey 23.      Pie Charts  A natural way to visualize relative frequencies is with a pie chart. A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes like slices of pizza or pie. The size of each wedge corresponds to the relative frequency of the category. The slices add up to 100%, just like relative frequencies. Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies in the pie slices.   Pie charts look nice but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them accurately we would need to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then measure the angle with a protractor. A spreadsheet is much better suited to drawing pie charts.   A pie chart for the same data as the previous bar chart. The relative frequencies are given in each pie piece: Green 24%; Red 19%; Black 18%; White 17%; Blue 11%; Grey 11%.      Using a Spreadsheet to Make Bar Charts and Pie Charts  To make a graph using a spreadsheet, place the data from the frequency table into the cells. Then select the data, go to the Insert tab, and choose the bar graph or pie chart that you would like. For this example, we will choose a pie graph.    This is a screen shot of excel that includes both the data and the Insert tab with various circle graph options.    After the spreadsheet has created your pie graph you can choose which design you prefer by clicking on the Chart Design tab. Since these pie pieces represent car colors, we matched the color of each wedge to the color of the car in our pie chart above.  To give your graph a meaningful title, click on Chart Title. There are many other settings that you can experiment with.    This is a screenshots of excel that shows the frequency table and pie chart and shows the Chart Design Tab.      Misleading Graphs  Graphs can be misleading intentionally or unintentionally. It's better to keep them simple, clear and well-labeled. People sometimes add features to graphs that don't help convey their information.    A 3-dimensional bar chart like the one shown is usually not as effective as a 2-dimensional graph. The extra dimension does not add any useful information.   A 3-D bar graph showing the car color data.    Here is another way that fanciness can sometimes lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it is tempting to substitute images. This type of graph is called a pictogram.     Perceptual Distortion  A pictogram is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to represent the frequency or size of the values being represented. We need to be careful with these, because our brains perceive the relationship between the areas, not the heights.   A labor union might produce this graph to show the difference between the average manager salary and the average worker salary.   The average manager salary is twice as high as the average worker salary as in a bar graph, but the image is also twice as wide. That makes it look like the manager salary is 4 times as large as the worker salary. The area needs to accurately portray the relationship, otherwise we will have a perceptual distortion.   There are two bags of money shown. One is larger labeled Mananger Salaries. The other is half as tall and half as wide and labeled workers salaries. There are no numbers or scale shown.       Misleading Scale  Another type of distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero. The baseline is the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that could have occurred in a category. Normally, this number should be zero.   Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December, 2008 CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation Poll. Dec 19-21, 2008, from . At a glance, the two graphs suggest very different stories. The second graph makes it look like more than three times as many people oppose marriage rights as support them. But when we look at the scale we can see that the difference is about 12%. By not starting at zero the difference looks enlarged.    A bar graph with a scale from 0-100%; There is a bar for support at about 44% and a bar for oppose at about 56%.    A bar graph of the same data but the scale goes from 40-60%; This magnifies the difference between the support and oppose groups.       Stacked Bar Graphs  Another type of graph that can be hard to read and sometimes misleading is a stacked bar graph. In a stacked bar graph , the values we are comparing are stacked on top of each other vertically.   The table lists college expenses for two different students and we want to compare them. A stacked bar graph shows the expenses stacked vertically, but we are interested in the differences, not the totals.    Expense  Student 1  Student 2    Rent  $500  $650    Food  $125  $125    Tuition  $1750  $1450    Books  $325  $275    Misc  $100  $175      A stacked bar graph with the bars for the expenses for student 2 placed on top of the bars for student 1.    A side-by-side bar graph with the bars for each student right next to each other.    It is much easier to interpret the differences in a side-by-side bar chart.     Presenting Quantitative Data  With categorical data, the horizontal axis is the category, but with quantitative, or numerical, data we have numbers. If we have repeated values we can also make a frequency table.   A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in their class. The scores in points are:    19  20  18  18  17  18  19  17  20  18  20  16  20  15  17    12  18  19  18  19  17  20  18  16  15  18  20  5  0  0    Here is a frequency table with the scores grouped and put in order.    Quiz Score  Frequency of Students    0  2    5  1    12  1    15  2    16  2    17  4    18  8    19  4    20  6     Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like we did for categorical data. However, since the scores are numerical values, this chart wouldn't make sense; the first and second bars would be five values apart, while the later bars would only be one value apart. Instead, we will treat the horizontal axis as a number line. This type of graph is called a histogram.    Histograms  A histogram is like a bar graph, but the horizontal axis is a number line. Unlike a bar graph, there are no spaces between the bars. Here are two histograms for the data given above. Notice that in the one on the left, the two scores of 15 are to the right of 15, or between 15 and 16. The horizontal scales on histograms can be confusing for this reason. Some people choose to have bars start at ½ values to avoid this ambiguity, as in the one on the right.    This is a histogram the x-axis is labeled score and goes from 0 to 21, with a scale of 1. The y-axis is labeled frequency an goes from 0 to 9 with a scale of 1. There are no spaces between the bars.    This is a histogram of the same data but this time the spaces are labeled 0 to 20 instead of the tick marks.    If we have a large number of different data values, a frequency table listing every possible value would be way too long. There would be too many bars on the histogram to reveal any patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data to group data into class intervals.    Class Intervals   Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:   Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from 120 up to but not including 135, the second class should include values from 135 up to but not including 150.    We typically have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, depending on the number of data values we're working with.     In the next example, we'll make a histogram using class intervals.   Suppose we have collected weights from 100 subjects who identify as male, as part of a nutrition study. For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of .  There are many ways to draw a histogram and we will explain one way as an example. We will create 10 classes by doing the following calculation: Take the range of 142 and divide it by 10 to find the class width.     Then we round up the class width so that the largest data value will be in one of the classes. So we round up to a class width of 15. Since the minimum data value is 121, we will choose 120 to start with since it is a multiple of 15 that is less than 121.     Interval  Frequency    120-134.99  4    135-149.99  14    150-164.99  16    165-179.99  28    180-194.99  12    195-209.99  8    210-224.99  7    225-239.99  6    240-254.99  2    255-269.99  3     This is a histogram of the data in the table; the x-axis is labeled weights(pounds) and goes from 120 to 270, with a scale of 15; The y-axis is labeled frequency and goes from 0 to 30 with a scale of 5. There are no spaces between the bars.     When using class intervals, it is much easier to use technology that was specifically designed to make histograms. GeoGebra is one program that lets you adjust the class widths to see which graph best displays the data.    Histograms Using Technology  We will be using GeoGebra throughout this chapter to make graphs and calculate summary statistics. There is an online version and one you can download at . To access the online version, select \"GeoGebra Classic from the GeoGebra home page. To download it, select \"App Downloads\" from the home page. The instructions are similar for both.   The first thing we need to do is enter the data in GeoGebra's spreadsheet. You can access the spreadsheet from Main Menu View Spreadsheet. Next, enter your data and select that column. Then click on the histogram icon in the menu bar on the left side and select One Variable Analysis.   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis     A new window will pop up showing a visual of the data. There is a drop-down menu for the type of graph, but histogram is the default. Notice that the bars are not lined up with the tick-marks at the bottom, so we want to edit this histogram. The slider bar at the top will let you see different class widths, but we want to choose our class widths manually.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the histogram     If you close the menu at the top right by clicking on the left pointing triangle, you will see a settings wheel. Click on the wheel and check the box for set classes manually. To match our previous histogram, we will start at 120 pounds and set a class width of 15 pounds.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box checked for Set Classes Manually.     Now the bars of the histogram match our previous graph, but we need to edit the axis labels to match. Click on the graph tab on the right side and uncheck the box for automatic dimensions. We set the x min, x max, x step, y min, y max and y step as shown.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box uncheckd for Automatic Dimensions. The dimensions entered are xMin 111; xMax 275; xStep 15; yMin -3.4033; yMax: 30.8; yStep 5 (The y-dimensions were automatic)     To put the graph in an assignment or a book such as this one, select the export icon and choose Export as Picture. The downloaded version also has a Copy to Clipboard option. Then insert the graph into any document and add axis labels.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the export icon    Here is our finished histogram:    The finished histogram from GeoGebra copied into a Word document. This is the same histogram as in Example 10.      The Shape of a Distribution  Once we have our histogram, we can use it to determine the shape of the data or distribution . When describing distributions, we are going to look at four characteristics: shape, center, spread and outliers. Center and spread (variation) will be covered in the next two sections.    Modality  The modality of a distribution indicates the number of peaks or hills in its histogram.   It is unimodal if it has one peak.    It is bimodal if it has two peaks.    It is multimodal if it has multiple peaks.      The first graph is unimodal , the second is bimodal and the third is multimodal .    Three histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak. The second histograms has two peaks. The third histogram has three peaks.     A bimodal distribution can result when two different populations have been grouped together and they are overlapping. It would be better to separate them into two separate graphs. For example, the grams of sugar per serving in sugar and non-sugar cereals.    Symmetry  A distribution is symmetric if the left side of the graph mirrors the right side.   The graph on the left is symmetric and unimodal while the graph on the right is roughly symmetric and bimodal.    Two histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak in the middle and the bars taper down symmetrically on each side. The second histogram has two peaks. Each of the peaks are similar in size and the graph is roughly symmetric.       Skewness  If a distribution is not symmetric then we say it is skewed. A graph can be skewed to the left or skewed to the right . We say it is skewed in the direction of the longer tail.    Skewed to the Left  A left skewed graph is also called a negatively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the left or negative side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the right of center and the bars go down to the left gradually.      Skewed to the Right  A right skewed graph is also called a positively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the right or positive side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the left of center and the bars go down to the right gradually.      The Normal Distribution  The normal distribution has a very specific shape. It is unimodal and symmetric with a bell-shaped graph.         Outlier   Outliers are data values that are unusually far away from the rest of the data. There is often a gap between the outlier and the rest of the graph. This visual determination of outliers is often subjective and depends on the situation.    In the graph to the right we have a unimodal distribution that is skewed to the right. There appears to be an outlier near 20.   This distribution has majority of it's data on the left there is a gap in the graph with one bar further away.

The percentages he spent in each category are pictured here. If he spent a total of $2,600 this month, how much did he spend on rent?    This is a pie chart with four regions. Fun is labeled 16%, Food is labeled 24%, Rent is labeled 26% and Other is labeled 34%.     Cory spent $676 on rent this month.    Habiba categorized the amount of time spent each week into 5 categories: Work, Travel, Housework, Leisure, and Sleep. If there are a total of 168 hours each week, how many hours does Habiba spend travelling each week?    This is a pie chart with five regions. Work is labled 29%, Travel is labeled 7%, Housework is labeled 12%, Leisure is labeled 23% and Sleep is labeled 29%.     Habiba spends 11.8 hours travelling each week.    In a survey Gallup Poll. March 5-8, 2009. , 1012 adults were asked whether they personally worried about a variety of environmental concerns. The number of people who indicated that they worried a great deal about some selected concerns is listed below.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a bar chart for these data.    Why can't we make a pie chart for these data?       Environmenal Issue  Frequency    Pollution of drinking water  597    Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste  526    Air pollution  455    Global warming  354        These data are categorical.      There are four spaced apart bars labeled Pollution of drinking water, Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste, Air pollution, and Global warming. The x-axis is labeled Environmental Issue and the y-axis is labeled frequncy. Pollution of drinking water goes up to 597, Contamination of soil and drinking water goes up to 526, Air pollution goes up to 455, and Global warming goes up to 354.      No, we cannot make a pie chart out of these data. The total of the relative frequencies is 1932, but only 1012 adults were asked. So some adults selected multiple options.       In a survey, 2056 adults were asked about their views on immigration. The percent of people who responded that immigrants to the United States are making each of the following situations in the country better are listed below.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency bar chart for these data.    Can we make a pie chart for these data?

There are six spaced apart bars labeled Food music and the arts, The economy in general, Social and moral values, Job opportunities for you and your family, Taxes, and Crime. The x-axis is labeled Situation and the y-axis is labeled Relative Frequency (%). Food music and the arts goes up to 57%, The economy in general goes up to 43%, Social and moral values goes up to 31%, Job opportunities for you and your family goes up to 19%, Taxes goes up to 20%, and Crime goes up to 7%.      No, we cannot make a pie chart for these data. The relative frequencies add to 177%, which is more than 100%.

Number of cars in household  Frequency    0-1  7    2-3  14    4-5  3        The histogram is titled \"Histogram of number of cars in household\". The x-axis is labeled Number of Cars, the scale goes from 0 to 6 and jumps by 1 unit. There are three bars, one from 0-2, one from 2-4, and one from 4-6. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 16 by units of two. The 0-2 bar goes to 7, the 2-4 bar goes to 14, and the 4-6 bar goes to 3.      These data are unimodal and skewed right, with no outliers.       The table below shows scores on a math test.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency table for the data using a class width of 10.    Construct a histogram of the data.    82  55  51  97  73  79  100  60  71  85  78  59    90  100  88  72  46  82  89  70  100  68  61  52           These are quantitative data.

The x-axis is labeled Scores, the scale goes from 40 to 110 and jumps by 10. There are seven bars, one from 40-50, one from 50-60, one from 60-70, one from 70-80, one from 80-90, one from 90-100, and one from 100-110. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 8 by two. The 40-50 bar goes to 1, the 50-60 bar goes to 4, the 60-70 bar goes to 3, the 70-80 bar goes to 6, the 80-90 bar goes to 5, the 90-100 bar goes to 2, and the 100-110 bar goes to 3.      These data are unimodal. There are no obvious outliers. The data are either symmetric or skewed left.       This graph shows the number of adults and kids who prefer each type of soda. There were 130 adults and kids surveyed. Discuss some ways in which the graph could be improved.    This is a 3 dimensional double bar graph. There is a bar for kids and a bar for adults. The x-axis is labeled coke, diet coke, sprite and cherry soda. The y-axis starts at 20 and goes to 45 with a scale of 5.     The graph would be more effective at displaying the true differences between the categories if the vertical scale started at 0. The vertical axis is missing a label and units, so we can't tell if those are frequencies or relative frequencies. A flat bar graph (instead of the 3d graph) would be easier to read.    A poll was taken asking people if they agreed with the positions of the 4 candidates for a county office. Does this pie chart present a good representation of these data? Explain.    A pie chart with 4 regions: Nguyen is labeled 42%, McKee is labeled 35%, Jones is labeled 64% and Brown is labeled 52%.     No, this chart does not present a good representation of these data. The percentages in a pie chart must add to 100%, but these add to 193%. A bar chart would be appropriate instead.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Favorite Drinks\". The x-axis is labeled Drink Type and includes colas, lemon flavored, root beer, teas, coffee, and other. The y-axis is labeled frequency and has no scale.     This is a poor graph because the vertical axis does not have a numerical scale, so we cannot know how many have each drink as a favorite drink. We also don't know if the bottom vertical line represents 0, which is potentially misleading.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Profit During First Half of Year\". The x-axis is labeled Year and includes January, February, March, April, May, and June. The y-axis is labeled Profits in $. The scale goes from 0 to 4500 by 500. The bar for each month is labeled with the following values: January 4230, February 3760, March 2670, April -1320, May 750, and June 1560. The bar for April is colored red while the remaining bars are colored blue.     This is a misleading graph because the -$1320 in April represents a loss (instead of a profit), but the height of the bar for April looks like a profit. Also, the horizontal axis label is Year , but the bar labels are months.    Match each description to one of the graphs.   Normal distribution    Positive or right skewed    Negative or left skewed    Bimodal       The frequency of times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.   This histogram has a tall bar on the left side, then the bars decrease significantly and then increase for a peak on the right side.     Scores on a 20-point statistics quiz.   This histogram has shorter bars to the left, which gradually get taller. The tallest bar is on the right side of the graph.       The distribution of scores on a psychology test.   This histogram increases sharply and then decreases gradually. The peak is just to the left of the center.     The number of heads in 24 sets of 100 coin flips.   This histogram is symmetric. The highest bar is in the middle and the bars decrease in height as you move away from the middle.         Normal distribution – The number of heads in 24 sets of 100 coin flips.    Positive or right skewed – Distribution of scores on a psychology test.    Negative or left skewed – Scores on a 20-point statistics quiz.    Bimodal – The frequency of times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.       Write a sentence or two to describe each distribution in terms of modality, symmetry, skewness and outliers.    This histogram has the tallest bars on the left side and then decreases to the right.    The bars in this histogram increase gradually to the center and then decrease. The bars drop off slightly faster to the right.      The bars in this histogram increase sharply to the tallest bars on the left side, then decrease and increase to the second tallest bar, then decrease again to the right.    The bars on this histogram start out at a middle height and then go down and up in a U shape to the tallest bar to the right of center. Then the bars decrease and increase again for another tall bar on the right.    The bars on this histogram gradually increase to the right and drop of quickly after the peak toward the right side of the graph.        This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There is a possible outlier between 10 and 11.    This distribution is unimodal and symmetric. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There are no obvious outliers.    This distribution is multimodal and left skewed. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and left skewed. There are no obvious outliers.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.   Create a histogram for each dataset, using the same class intervals and scales so you can compare them.    Compare and contrast the two distributions.  Researcher 1 Patients (in months):    3  4  11  15  16  17  22  44  37  16  14  24  25  15  26  27  33  29  35  44    13  21  22  10  12  8  40  32  26  27  31  34  29  17  8  24  18  47  33  34    Researcher 2 Patients (in months):    3  14  11  5  16  17  28  41  31  18  14  14  26  25  21  22  31  2  35  44    23  21  21  16  12  18  41  22  16  25  33  34  29  13  18  24  23  42  33  29                       The data for patients of both researchers are symmetric. Researcher's 1 patients' data appears to be unimodal, but Researcher 2's patients' data may be bimodal or multimodal. The data for Researcher 1's patients does not have any outliers, but the data for Researcher's 2 may have outliers between 0 and 5 months or 40 and 45 months.       "

A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories.

For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of .  There are many ways to draw a histogram and we will explain one way as an example. We will create 10 classes by doing the following calculation: Take the range of 142 and divide it by 10 to find the class width.     Then we round up the class width so that the largest data value will be in one of the classes. So we round up to a class width of 15. Since the minimum data value is 121, we will choose 120 to start with since it is a multiple of 15 that is less than 121.

  "title": "Summary Statistics: Measures of Center",
  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Center   In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numbers to summarize quantitative distributions. We want to know what an average value is (where the data is centered), and how spread out the values are. Together, the center and spread provide important information which can be used to estimate our population parameters. In this section we will discuss the measures of center and in the next section we will discuss the measures of spread.     Students will be able to:     Calculate the mean, median, and mode of data organized in lists and frequency tables.    Analyze the relationship of the mean and median to the shape of the data.    Interpret mean, median, and mode in context.      Measures of Center  There are a few different types of averages that measure the center, and the one we use will depend on the shape of the distribution. We will mention the mode but focus mainly on the two most common averages : the mean and the median .    Mode  In the previous section, we saw that the modes are related to the peaks where similar values are grouped. The mode is the value with the highest frequency (A mode is the value where a peak occurs. One additional way to calculate the mode(s) is to take the midpoint of each peak in the histogram.)    The first ten ratings (from 1 to five stars) on a blender available at an online store are as follows: 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 5. Find and interpret the mode.    The rating 1 occurs twice, 2 occurs once, 3 occurs once, 4 occurs once, and 5 occurs five times. Since 5 occurs the most times, the mode is 5 . This means that the most common rating is 5 stars.      Mean  The mean , or more formally the arithmetic mean, is what probably comes to mind when you hear the word average. The calculation of the mean uses every data value in the distribution and is therefore strongly affected by skew and outliers.  To calculate the mean of a distribution, we divide the sum of the data values by the number of data values we have. The sample mean is usually represented by, a lower-case with a bar over it, read-bar. The lower-case letter n is used to represent the number of data values or sample size .   Mean        Mirabel's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, and 94. What is her mean test score?    To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores ( ). The mean is:     We will round the sample mean to one more decimal place than the original data. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3 points. Also notice that the mean has the same units as the data and it is important to label it.    It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when the data set is small, but if the data set is large, or if you will be finding additional statistics, then technology is the way to go. We can find the mean of a data set using the spreadsheet formula =AVERAGE .   The price of peanut butter in dollars at 5 stores was 3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, and 3.99. Find the mean price using a spreadsheet.  There are two ways to use the =AVERAGE formula. If your data set is not too large, you can enter each value directly into the formula. Using this method, we write   =AVERAGE(3.29 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the values.    and we get an answer of $3.68.  The other method is to enter the data values into a single column (or row) of the spreadsheet and reference the column (or row) range in the formula. We can enter the range by highlighting the data values. As illustrated below, if we enter the data into column A, the formula is   =AVERAGE(A1:A5)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in column A    and we also get an answer of $3.68.   Sometimes when there is a lot of data with repeated values we are given a frequency table.   One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below.    Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    $15  6    $20  8    $25  11    $30  17    $35  19    $40  20    $45  12    $50  7    Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:     We can calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as . Using this simplification, we get     The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.   We could also use =AVERAGE to find the mean for this example, but it would require entering each repeated value individually. If the mean is all we need, then taking advantage of multiplication as repeated addition is the more straightforward way to go. We could also enter the frequency table and the calculation above in a spreadsheet.   Extending the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood and has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). Adding this to our sample, our mean becomes:     While 83.1 thousand dollars, or $83,100 is the correct mean household income for the new sample, it is no longer representative of the neighborhood – in fact, it is greater than every income in the sample aside from the new one we added!   Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value at the tip of the triangle that keeps the data in balance, like in the picture below.    A drawing of a see-saw with rectangles to indicate the data values. Most of the data values are to the left of the fulcrum; the two values to the right are spread out which causes the data to be balanced.    If we graph our household data, the $5 million value is so far out to the right that the mean has to adjust to keep things in balance.    With the outlier data value added, the see-saw is extended with that value far to the right. Now all of the original data values are to the left of the fulcrum.    For this reason, when working with data that is skewed or has outliers, it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.    Median  The median of a data set is the middle value, when the data are listed in order from smallest to largest. We can also think of the median as the value that has 50% of the data below it and 50% of data above it. As we will discover later, the median is also the 50th percentile .   Median  If the number of data values is odd, then the median is the middle data value If the number of data values is even, then the median is the mean of the middle pair    Finding the median of an odd number of values.  Use the following quiz scores in points:    5  10  8  6  4  8  2  5  7  7  6    We must start by listing the data in order:    2  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  10    It is helpful to mark or cross off the numbers as you list them to make sure you don't miss any. Also, be sure to count the number of data values in your ordered list to make sure it matches the number of data values in the original list.  In this example there are 11 quiz scores. When the distribution contains an odd number of data values there will be a single number in the middle and that is the median. For small data sets, we can “walk” one value at a time from the ends of the ordered list towards the center to find the median     The median test score is 6 points.    Finding the median of an even number of values.  Use the following quiz scores in points:    2  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  10  20    There are now 12 quiz scores in our sample. When the distribution contains an even number of data values there will be a pair of values in the middle rather than a single value. Then we take the average of the middle two values.     Median points  Notice that despite adding an outlier to our data set, the median is largely unaffected. The median quiz score for the new distribution is 6.5 points. The median is not as affected by outliers as the mean is.  We can also find the median using the spreadsheet formula =MEDIAN . Just like the spreadsheet function =AVERAGE , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row (or column) and use the row range (or column range) in the formula.  Using the data values of the original distribution, we can write the function as   =MEDIAN(2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10) or   =MEDIAN(A1:AK)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in row 1    and we get 6 points for the median test score.    Let's continue with our peanut butter example and find the median both by hand and with a spreadsheet. The price of peanut butter at 5 stores in dollars was:    3.29  3.59  3.79  3.75  3.99    To find the median by hand, we must first list the prices in order. This give us:    3.29  3.59  3.75  3.79  3.99    Since there are an odd number of data values in the sample ( ), we know that the median will be the single data value in the middle of the ordered list.     The median price of peanut butter at these five stores is $3.75.  Using a spreadsheet, we write   =MEDIAN(3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula with all the data values typed in.    and we get a median price of $3.75.   It is worth noting that when you use a spreadsheet to find the median you do not have to order the data first. You can enter the data values in the order they are given to you.    The Relationship Between the Mean and the Median  If a distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew, as we saw in the see-saw diagram. In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, while in a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. If the distribution is symmetric, the mean and the median will be approximately equal.  To demonstrate this, we have entered some data in GeoGebra, as previously explained, and made histograms. To see the statistics that GeoGebra calculates, we click on the summation symbol on the right-hand menu bar.   Fifty people from the Portland Metro area who are employed full time were sampled and their annual salaries were recorded (to the nearest thousand dollars). The histogram and summary statistics from GeoGebra are shown below.  From the histogram we can see that the shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We can see from the statistics output on the left that the mean is greater than the median. This is because the few people with higher incomes bring the average up.   Mean , Median , Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the right. The statistics output shows the mean is $67,160 and the Median is $53,500.      A random selection of 30 math 105 exams at PCC were sampled and their scores were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the left. There also appears to be an outlier between 20 and 30. We can see from the statistics output that the mean is less than the median. This is because the low test score brought the average down. points points   Mean points, Median points, Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the left. The statistics output shows the mean is 81.7 points and the Median is 87.5 points.      Nineteen people identifying as female were sampled and their heights (in inches) were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and roughly symmetric. We can also see from the statistics output that the mean and the median are approximately equal. inches inches   Mean inches, Median inches Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is approximately symmetric. The statistics output shows the mean is 62.6 inches and the Median is 62 inches.     We can use these observations in reverse as well. If we know the mean is greater than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right. If the mean is less than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the left. When the mean and the median are approximately equal, the distribution is likely to be symmetric.    Recent college graduates were asked how much student loan debt they have. The data has a mean of $46,265 and a median of $33,652. Just based on this information, do you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right?    Since the mean is greater than the median, we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right.      Exercises   A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a breakfast in dollars.

Use the following table is the cost of purchasing a car at a local dealership.  Some of the cars sold were new and some were used.     Calculate find the mean, including units.    Can you figure out how to find the median using the frequency table? See if you can do it without listing out all the data values.    Based on the mean and the median, would you expect the distribution to be symmetric skewed left or skewed right? Explain.

Then use the Show Statistics option.     The sum of the frequencies is 75, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 75 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 38th value in the list. The 38th value is 35, so the median is 35 thousand dollars.    Since the mean is less than the median, we would expect the distribution to be skewed left.       As part of a study of email, a researcher counted the length of 34 emails. The lengths of the emails are shown below, rounded to the nearest thousand characters (so a length 0 means that the numbers of characters rounded to 0, not that the message was blank). The data is from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. ( ).      Calculate and find the mean, including units.    Can you figure out how to find the median using the frequency table? See if you can do it without listing all the data values.    Based on the mean and the median, would you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right?

Then use the Show Statistics option.     The sum of the frequencies is 34, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 34 values (an even number), we know that the median will be the mean of the two middle values. Because , we know the two middle values are the 17th and 18th values. The 17th value is 4, and the 18th value is 5, so the median is 4.5 thousand characters.    Since the mean is greater than the median, we expect the distribution to be skewed right.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.  Researcher 1 Patients (in months):    3  4  11  15  16  17  22  44  37  16  14  24  25  15  26  27  33  29  35  44    13  21  22  10  12  8  40  32  26  27  31  34  29  17  8  24  18  47  33  34    Researcher 2 Patients (in months):    3  14  11  5  16  17  28  41  31  18  14  14  26  25  21  22  31  2  35  44    23  21  21  16  12  18  41  22  16  25  33  34  29  13  18  24  23  42  33  29       Find the mean and median of each group.    Compare and contrast the two groups.         For Researcher 1:  In Excel:   =average(A1:A40)    months.   =median(A1:A40)    months  The mean for Researcher 1's patients is 23.6 months, and the median for Researcher's 1 patients is 24 months.  For Researcher 2:  In Excel:   =average(A1:A40)    months   =median(A1:A40)    months  The mean for Researcher 2's patients is 22.8 months, and the median is 22 months    Both the mean and median for Researcher 1's patients are greater than the mean and median for Researcher 2's patients. So, on average, Researcher 1's patients have a longer life time after starting the cancer treatment than Researcher 2's patients.       The US Census Bureau, in addition to counting the population of the US every 10 years, conducts yearly informational surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS). For the 2012 ACS, a randomly chosen group of 20 respondents (10 males, 10 females) answered a question about their incomes. Data from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.1 Exercise #1.

For Females:   =average(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)       =median(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)      The mean for females is $20,727, and the median for females is $22,500    Both the mean income and median income for the males in the sample were twice as large as the mean income and median income for the females in the sample. The difference between the mean and median income for the females was slightly larger than the mean and median income for the males, so the distribution of incomes for the females is possibly more skewed than the distribution for the males.

The distribution for beginners looks unimodal and left-skewed. The distribution for tournament players appears bimodal and symmetric.  The mean and median number of pieces correctly remembered were both greatest for tournament players, with non-players having the smallest mean and median of pieces correctly remembered.       There is evidence that smiling can attenuate judgments of possible wrongdoing. This phenomenon termed the \"smile-leniency effect\" was the focus of a study by Marianne LaFrance & Marvin Hecht in 1995 LaFrance, M., & Hecht, M. A. (1995) Why smiles generate leniency. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 207-214. Adapted from , by David M. Lane, et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . The following data are measurements of how lenient the sentences were for three different types of smiles and one neutral control. A higher number indicates greater leniency. The same subject was used for all of the conditions so that may affect the results.   Make a histogram for each smile type and the neutral control.    Find the mean for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Find the median for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Compare the shapes of the distributions as well as the centers for each type of smile and control.

The mean leniency for the felt smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the neutral control group was 4.1.    The median leniency for the false smile group was 5.5.  The median leniency for the felt smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the neutral control group was 4.0.    Answers will vary depending on the graphs created. The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4       Make up three data sets with 5 values each that have:   The same mean but different medians    The same median but different means.         There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values each that have the same mean but different medians are:    0,  0,  0,  0,  10    0,  0,  2,  4,  4    0,  1,  1,  1,  7      There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values that have the same median but different means are:    10,  10,  10,  10,  10    0,  0,  10,  15,  20    1,  5,  10,  10,  10         The frequency table below shows the number of women's shoes that were sold in an hour at a local shoe store.     Would you treat this data as categorical or quantitative?    How would the bar graph be different from the histogram?    Treat the data as quantitative and find the mean and the median. Are these useful statistics?    Shoe Size  Frequency    5  4    6  4    7  6    8  6    9  5           Argument for categorical: Because it is not clear that the shoe sizes represent a measure, the data can be considered categorical.  Argument for quantitative: Because shoe size is a measurement that corresponds to the length of someone's foot, it can be treated as quantitative data.    Each graph would have frequency along the y-axis. In a bar graph the bars would have spaces between them and each bar would be labeled with the shoe size. In a histogram there would not be any spaces between the bars and the shoe sizes could be the scale on the x-axis.    The mean shoe size to be 7.2 and the median shoe size to be 7.  The mean shoe size is:     Since there are 25 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 13th value in the list. The 13th value is 7, so the median shoe size is 7.  The mean and median shoe size might be useful statistics to the store. If shoe size is positively correlated to height, then a shoe store with a comparatively larger mean or median shoe size could determine that their clients are, on average, comparatively taller. (Other answers are possible.)       At the end of the term, 400 students take a final exam, and their scores (as percentages) are plotted in a histogram. Graph and description from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.2 Exercise.

Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is skewed left.    I expect that the mean is less than the median because the graph is skewed left.       The following graph shows the distribution of yearly incomes of 40 patrons at a college coffee shop. Graph and description from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.2 Exercise. ( )     The bars on the histogram increase gradually with the tallest bars in the center, then decrease gradually.       Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed right, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is symmetric. The graph has a single peak between $65,000 an $66,000, and there are approximately an equal number of data values on either side of this peak.    I expect that the mean and median are equal because the graph is symmetric.       For each of the following distributions, would you expect that the mean is less than the median, greater than the median, or approximately equal to the median? Explain your reasoning.     Household incomes in the US    Weights of newborn babies born at term    The number of children in a household in the US    Medical costs for all adults    Medical costs for adults in the US older than 65         Incomes are skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Weights are approximately symmetric so the mean would be about the same as the median.    Number of children is skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Medical costs for all adults are most likely skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Medical costs for adults 65+ may be symmetric or skewed to the right. Answer according to the shape you chose.       "

The median leniency for the neutral control group was 4.0.    Answers will vary depending on the graphs created. The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4     "

  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation    Students will be able to:     Calculate and describe the measures of variation: standard deviation, range and interquartile range (IQR)    Calculate the 5-number summary and construct boxplots by hand and\/or using technology (boxplots using technology may be modified or not)    Compare distributions with side-by-side boxplots and percentiles    Calculate and apply Z-scores      text goes here    Measures of Variation  Consider these three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz:  Section A:    5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5    Section B:    0  0  0  0  0  10  10  10  10  10    Section C:    4  4  4  5  5  5  5  6  6  6    All three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class got no points and the other half got a perfect score. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.  Thus, in addition to the mean and median, which are measures of center or the average value, we also need a measure of how spread out \" or varied each data set is.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the standard deviation , range and the interquartile range (IQR) .    Standard Deviation  The sample standard deviation, s , is a measure of variation that tells us how far, on average, the data values deviate, or are different from, the mean. The mean and standard deviation are paired to provide a measure of center and spread for symmetric distributions.   Sample Standard Deviation     where is the sample size, or the number of data values   We will go through the whole process for calculating the standard deviation. Let's say there is another section of quiz scores:  Section D:    0  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  10    The mean quiz score, like Sections A, B and C, is 5 points.  The first step in finding the standard deviation is to find the deviation, or difference, of each data value from the mean. We will do this in a table. You could also use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.    Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)    0     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     10     We would like to get an idea of the average deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in the second column, the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square the deviations.    Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)  Deviation Squared    0      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      10      Next, we add the squared deviations and we get     Ordinarily, we would then divide by the number of scores, , (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations, but the division by is only done if the data set represents a population. When the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we divide by (in this case,).  We assume Section D represents a sample, so we will divide by 9. Note that our units are now points-squared since we squared all of the deviations. It is much more meaningful to use the units we started with, so to convert back to points we take the square root.  The sample standard deviation for Section D is     For comparison, here is the standard deviation for each section listed above:   points   points   points   points  For the standard deviation, we usually use two more decimal places than the original data. This tells us that on average, scores were 2.36 points away from the mean of 5 points. In summary, here are the steps to calculate the standard deviation by hand.   Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation     Find the deviations by subtracting the mean from each data value    Square each deviation    Add the squared deviations    Compute the square root of the sum divided by :         There are a few important characteristics we want to keep in mind when finding and interpreting the standard deviation.   The standard deviation is never negative. It will be zero if all the data values are equal and get larger as the data spreads out.    The standard deviation has the same units as the original data and it is important to label it.    The standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.      To continue our peanut butter example, we will find the standard deviation of this sample in dollars: 3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, and 3.99.  The first thing we need to find is the sample mean, and we know it is $3.68 from our previous work. Next, we need to find the deviation from the mean for each data value and square it.    Data Value  Deviation  Deviation Squared    $3.29      $3.59      $3.79      $3.75      $3.99      The sum of the deviations squared is     The sample standard deviation is     Since the units are dollars, we will round to two decimal places rather than two more than the data. This gives us a standard deviation of $0.26. Together with the mean this tells us that on average, the cost of a jar of peanut butter is $0.26 away from the mean of $3.68.   Calculating the standard deviation by hand can be quite a nuisance when we are dealing with a large data set, so we can also use technology. We use the spreadsheet function =STDEV.S to find the sample standard deviation. Notice that this is different from the population standard deviation, which uses the function =STDEV.P .  Just like the spreadsheet functions =AVERAGE and =MEDIAN , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row or column and use the row or column range in the formula.    The total cost of textbooks, in dollars, for the term was collected from 36 students. Use a spreadsheet to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the sample.    140  160  160  165  180  220  235  240  250  260  280  285    285  285  290  300  300  305  310  310  315  315  320  320    330  340  345  350  355  360  360  380  395  420  460  460    Since we are finding more than one statistic for this data set, it is much more efficient to enter the data values into a row or column and reference the range in each of the formulas. We enter the data into column A.     For the mean we enter: =AVERAGE(A1:A36) and get a result of $299.58.  For the median we enter: =MEDIAN(A1:A36) and get a result of $307.50.  For the standard deviation we enter: =STDEV.S(A1:A36) and get $78.68.   The mean and the median are relatively close to each other, so we can expect the distribution to be approximately symmetric with maybe a slight skew to the left, since the mean is smaller. The mean and standard deviation together tell us that the average cost of textbooks for a term is about $299.58, give or take $78.68.    In addition to a spreadsheet, we will continue our use of GeoGebra. Let's take a look at how to use GeoGeogebra to find the mean, median and standard deviation for the last example. We begin just like we did for making a histogram.    continued: We enter the textbook data into column A of the spreadsheet in GeoGebra. (Main Menu →View →Spreadsheet). Next, select the column title of your data, click on the histogram in the menu bar on the left, and select One Variable Analysis.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis    Then you will see the histogram. It is always a good idea to check the shape of your distribution before calculating anything. Notice our histogram matches what we found about the distribution from the mean and median. It is approximately symmetric or slightly skewed to the left.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram. The summation symbol to show summary statistics is on the right side.    Next, we click the summation symbol in the menu bar on the right. The list of summary statistics will pop up as you can see in the image below. We see that the mean is $299.58, the median is $307.50 and the sample standard deviation is $78.68 – just like we found using the spreadsheet formulas.  The statistics we will use are the sample size , the mean, median, and the sample standard deviation . The last five entries in the table – min, Q1, median, Q3, and max – together make up the 5-number summary which we will learn about shortly!    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data, histogram and summary statistics.    The standard deviation is the measure of variation that we pair with the mean for approximately symmetric distributions. This pairing should make sense because the standard deviation uses the mean in its calculation. But what about the median? What measure of variation do we pair with it?     Range  One candidate is the range . The range tells us the spread or width of the entire data set. We calculate the range as the difference between the maximum and minimum value.   Range      However, the range is not a very good measure of variation since it is very strongly affected by skew and outliers. Consider, for example, the distribution of full time salaries in the United States. Many people earn a minimum wage salary, while others like Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Bill Gates (Microsoft) earn millions (if not billions!). A range this large does very little to help us get a sense of the spread where most of the data values lie.    Quartiles and the Interquartile Range  Instead, the measure of variation that we pair with the median is the interquartile range (IQR) . The IQR tells us the width of the middle 50% of data values. By cutting off the lower and upper 25% of data values, we are able to ignore extreme values and provide a more accurate sense of how spread out the distribution is.  The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Before we can calculate the interquartile range, though, we need to learn how to find the first and third quartiles.   Interquartile Range (IQR)      As the name implies, quartiles are values that divide the data into quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the value that 25% of the data lie below. The third quartile (Q3) is the value that 75% of the data lie below. As you might have guessed, the second quartile is the same as the median since 50% of the data values lie below it.  We have seen that the data is split in half by the median so to split it into quarters, we find the median of each half of the data.   Quartiles   the median of the lower half of the data   is the median of the whole data set   is the median of the upper half of the data  If there is an odd number of data values, we don't use the median in either half     For an even number of data values: Suppose we have measured the height, in inches, of 12 people who identify as female. The data values are listed below. Find the interquartile range.    59  60  69  64  70  72  66  64  67  66  63  61      Just like when finding the median, we must first order the data.    59  60  61  63  64  64  66  66  67  69  70  72    Then we divide the data into two halves. In the case of an even sample size, we split the distribution down the middle. The first 6 data values are the lower half and the next 6 data values are the upper half. Then we find the median of each. The median of the lower half is Q1 and the median of the upper half is Q3.      In this data inches, and inches. Then we subtract to find the IQR.     This tells us the that the middle 50% of the women's heights lie within an interval of 6 inches.      For an odd number of data values: Suppose we added one more height (68 inches) to the data set from the previous example. We will again find the interquartile range of the heights.    59  60  61  63  64  64  66  66  67  68  69  70  72      The data are already in order, but we have an odd number of values. To deal with this we do not use the median in the upper or lower halves. The lower half will include the values strictly below the median, and the upper half will include the values strictly above the median.     Then the interquartile range is:     If the data set is small, we can find the first and third quartiles by hand, but we have also seen that they are part of the output from GeoGebra. Here is the output for this data.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    From the list of summary statistics we can see that and inches. Now we can calculate the interquartile range.     This is the same value we found by hand.    It is important to note that we are not using spreadsheets for the five-number summary because they do not calculate the quartiles in the same way, so they will not give the same results. Now that we have learned how to find the quartiles we can make a five-number summary and boxplot.    The Five-Number Summary and Boxplots  The five-number summary is made up of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and the maximum. These five values divide the data into quarters. A boxplot , also called a box-and-whisker plot , is a graphical representation of the five-number summary. Each region of the boxplot contains approximately the same number of data values, so we can see the spread for each region. We can find the five-number summary and draw a boxplot by hand or by using GeoGebra. In our last example the five-number summary from GeoGebra is: 59, 62, 66, 68.5, 72 inches.   Five-Number Summary      We will use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for the next example and then explain how to draw a boxplot.    Let's continue with the cost of textbook data in dollars from . Use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for this sample and draw a boxplot by hand.    140  160  160  165  180  220  235  240  250  260  280  285    285  285  290  300  300  305  310  310  315  315  320  320    330  340  345  350  355  360  360  380  395  420  460  460      As we found before, here is the GeoGebra output. The last five entries of the summary statistics are the five-number summary. Remember to label all of your statistics with units.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    The five-number summary is    Min   Median   Max    $140  $255  $307.50  $347.50  $460    To draw the boxplot, we will first draw a number line that extends a little beyond the minimum and maximum values, and choose a scale. We decided to draw our number line from $120 to $480, in increments of $40. Then we add a meaningful title and units.  Next, make vertical lines at the first quartile, median and third quartile and connect them to form a box. This is the middle 50% of the data and you might notice that the width of the box is the IQR. Then, extend the whiskers out to the minimum and maximum values. Note that a boxplot does not have a vertical scale and the height of the box does not matter. Our boxplot looks like this:    A boxplot with a horizontal scale from $120 to $480 with a scale of $40.    GeoGebra will also draw boxplots for us. We enter and select the data values like we have done before and select One Variable Statistics. This brings up the graphics window with a histogram by default. Use the drop-down menu to select the boxplot. We also click on to show the summary statistics.      We will continue with our height data, in inches, from the 12 people who identify as women. Find the five-number summary and create a boxplot using GeoGebra.      59  60  69  64  70  72  66  64  67  66  63  61    Following the steps above we have the following GeoGebra output. The last five entries in the statistics table are the five-number summary and we have the boxplot on the right.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showint the data, summary statistics and the boxplot.    Here is the five-number summary:    Min   Median   Max    59in  62in  65in  68in  72in    For this data, the two sides of the box and the two whiskers are approximately the same width. This suggests that the distribution is symmetric. We can verify this by noticing that the mean is approximately equal to the median.  The boxplot can tell us the shape of the distribution, but we cannot tell how many peaks the data has. For that we need a histogram. We can see the histogram and boxplot together by selecting the icon that looks like two rectangles stacked, or an = sign.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram and boxplot stacked.    Now we have a full picture of the data.    The default boxplot in GeoGebra is called a modified box plot , which shows the data values that are outliers with an X but requires a few more steps to make by hand. To change from the modified box plot to a regular box plot, click on the left pointing arrow in the boxplot window (downloaded version) or the settings wheel (online version) for options, and uncheck “show outliers.” The output window below shows two side-by-side boxplots (the regular boxplot on top and the modified boxplot on the bottom) illustrating the distribution of the annual salaries for 50 randomly selected full-time workers in the Portland Metro area.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing two boxplots for the same data stacked. The first one is the regular boxplot and show outliers is unchecked; the second one has 4 outliers on the right side and the box for show outliers is checked.    From the upper boxplot we can see that this distribution is skewed to the right and the upper quarter of the data is very spread out. It is natural to think of the data values as being evenly spread out in each region, but that is quite often not the case. From the lower boxplot we can see that there are 4 data values that are considered outliers and how far away the last data value is from the others. This is why it is useful to show outliers on a boxplot.    Modified Boxplot (Optional)  If you are curious to know how a modified boxplot is made, we will explain it briefly. There is a rule called the 1.5*IQR rule to determine which points are considered outliers. An outlier is a point that is more than 1.5 IQRs away from the middle 50% of the data (the box in the boxplot). We know how to calculate the IQR and then we multiply that by 1.5. We subtract that from Q1 to find the lower fence and add that value to Q3 to find the upper fence . Values beyond the fences are considered outliers and are drawn with an X or a star. Then we draw the whiskers of a modified box plot to the furthest data value inside the fence on each side.    Percentiles  Back when we were finding the median, we mentioned that the median is also called the 50th percentile, because 50% of the data values lie below it. We can define any percentile as the data value with that percentage of values below it. Since we have found the quartiles, we can also identify the 25th and 75th percentiles for our data. Q1 is the 25th percentile because 25% of the data values lie below it and Q3 is the 75th percentile because 75% of the data values lie below it.  Percentiles are used when comparing the growth of children to the population and in the results of standardized tests, such as the SAT test. If a person scored in the 83rd percentile, that means they scored higher than 83% of the people who took the test.    Comparing Distributions  Box plots and percentiles are particularly useful for comparing data from two populations.    The box plots of service times for two fast-food restaurants are shown below. Compare the length of time to get served at the two restaurants. Which one should you go to if you are in a hurry?      The boxplot for Store 1 shows a 5-number summary of 0.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.9, 6.3 minutes. The boxplot for Store 2 shows a 5-number summary of 0.5, 1.1, 2.1, 5.7, 9.6 minutes.    Store 2 has a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), but the service times are less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.  The 75th percentiles are 2.9 and 5.7 minutes. That means at store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of customers were served within 5.7 minutes.  Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinion about luck – 25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.      The boxplots below show the 5-number summaries of the birth weights, in kilograms, of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS) van Vliet, P.K. and Gupta, J.M. (1973) Sodium bicarbonate in idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. Arch. Disease in Childhood, 48, 249–255. As quoted on . The boxplots are separated to show the birth weights of infants who survived and those that did not. What can we conclude from this data?      The boxplot for infants who survived shows a 5-number summary of approximately 1.2, 1.8, 2.2, 2.9, 3.7 kg. The boxplot for infants who died shows a 5-number summary of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8 kg.    Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.  Similarly, looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.      Z-Scores  Have you ever heard the saying that you can't compare apples and oranges? It turns out that you can - provided we standardize their measures first!  We will be using the standard score called a Z-score, which is a method commonly used with unimodal and symmetric distributions (called normal or nearly normal distributions ). Z-scores may be used with any data, but if the distribution is skewed, then the distribution of Z-scores will also be skewed.  To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we find out how far away from the mean it is by subtracting. Then we divide by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide   If a data value is above the mean, its Z-score will be positive. If a data value is below the mean, its Z-score will be negative. Therefore, if a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is +1. If it is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean, its Z-score is -2.5. Note that the units of Z-scores are standard deviations, not the units of the data values.  We can use Z-scores to determine the relative unusualness of a data value with respect to its own distribution. That is what allows us to compare two unlike items. The convention in statistics is to say that a data value is unusual if it is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, or in other words, if its Z-score is less than -2 or greater than +2.   The oranges at a local grocery store have a mean diameter of 5.8 inches and a standard deviation of 1.2 inches. The apples, on the other hand, have a mean diameter of 4.2 inches and a standard deviation of 0.6 inches.  Ali closes their eyes and selects and apple and an orange. When they look at both pieces of fruit, they seem small. If the orange has a diameter of 4.2 inches and the apple has a diameter of 3.5 inches, which is smaller relative to their respective piles of fruit?  To determine which fruit is relatively smaller, Ali can find each of their Z-scores.     By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple's Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.  We can also find Z-scores using a spreadsheet with this formula:   =STANDARDIZE(data value, mean, standard deviation)   To verify our apple and orange Z-scores, we would write:   Apple: =STANDARDIZE(4.2, 5.8, 1.2) and we get -1.33 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.     Orange: =STANDARDIZE (3.5, 4.2, 0.6) and we get -1.17 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.      The mean weight of men over the age of 20 is 195.7 pounds 2016 CDC Report. . The study included all ethnicities but the report does not say whether transgendered men were included. with a standard deviation of 29.8 pounds. The mean weight of domestic cats is 8.6 pounds with a standard deviation of 1.2 pounds. (The standard deviation for men's weights is estimated. The cat's mean weight is based on ideal cat weight and the standard deviation is approximate).  At his peak, Andre the Giant, the 7-foot-4-inch French professional wrestler and actor, weighed 520 pounds. When Georgie the cat was at his peak he weighed 24 pounds. Who was more giant – Andre the Giant or Georgie the cat?  Since the weights of cats and men cannot be compared directly, we will need to calculate the Z-scores.     Using the standardize function, we would write:   Andre: =STANDARDIZE (520, 197.5, 29.8) which gives us 10.88 standard deviations.  Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual. However, since the Z-score for Georgie's weight is larger, he is even more giant than Andre the Giant.     Exercises   Many of the datasets from the Measures of Center section are repeated here so you can use your previous work to help you.    A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a breakfast in dollars. Their responses were:    7.50  25  10  10  7.50  8.25  9  5  15  8  7.25  7.50  8  7  12       Using your mean from , find the standard deviation of this data. Explain what the mean and standard deviation tell you about how much the group of diners would pay for a meal.    Calculate the five-number summary for this data.    Calculate the range and IQR for this data.    Create a boxplot for the data.         In Excel:  Entering the data values into cells A1 through A15.     From , the mean is $9.80. There are 15 data values, so .  We will make a table of data values, their deviations from the mean, and the squared deviations:    Data Value  Deviation  Deviation Squared                                                                               Next, we add the squared deviations and get dollars-squared.  The sample standard deviation is:       In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the five-number summary.

The side-by-side boxplots show salaries for actuaries and CPAs.   Estimate the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for CPA and actuary salaries.    Deshawn makes the median salary for an actuary. Kelsey makes the first quartile salary for a CPA. Who makes more money? How much more?    What percentage of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA?    What percentage of CPAs earn less than all actuaries?    The boxplot for CPA salary shows a 5-number summary of 30, 40, 75, 90, 100 in thousand dollars. The boxplot for Actuary salary shows a 5-number summary of 40, 75, 90, 94, 110 in thousand dollars           The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are, respectively, the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile for the data sets. Reading the boxplot for CPAs, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for CPAs' salaries are, respectively, $40,000, $75,000, and $90,000. Reading the boxplot for actuaries, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for actuaries' salaries are, respectively, $75,000, $90,000, and $94,000    Deshawn's salary (the median salary for an actuary) is $90,000; Kelsey's salary (the first quartile salary) is also $75,000. So Deshawn makes more than Kelsey, by $15,000.    75% of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA ($75,000).    25% of all CPAs earn less than all actuaries.       Fifty juniors and fifty seniors at a local high school were surveyed to find out how many hours per week they spend studying.

Olivia studies the maximum number of weekly study hours for a junior. Lucy studies the first quartile weekly study time for a senior. Who studies more, and by how many hours?    What percentage of juniors study between the minimum and median weekly study times for seniors?    What percentage of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors?         The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times for the juniors are 1 hour, 3 hours, and 4 hours, respectively. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times the seniors are 5.5 hours, 6 hours, and 9 hours.    Olivia studies more each week than Lucy, by 30 minutes.    50% of juniors study between the minimum and median number of hours for seniors.    100% of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors.       Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 25 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 21.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation of gas mileage for cars of that model is 1.15 mpg.   Find the Z-score for the gas mileage of your car.    Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your Z-score.              The -score for the gas mileage of the car is -3.13 standard deviations.       According to a local marathon club, the mean finishing time for a marathon is 274 minutes, with a standard deviation of 63 minutes.     If I can run a marathon with a finishing time of 170 minutes, find the Z-score for my marathon time.    Is my marathon finishing time of 170 minutes unusually fast? Explain your answer using the Z-score.            The marathon time's -score is -1.65 standard deviations.    Because the marathon finishing time is within 2 standard deviations of the mean finishing time, no, this marathon finishing time is not usually fast.       This data set is a sample of the average number of hours per year that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 11 cities:    56  53  53  50  46  45  44  43  42  40  36       Find the mean and the standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z-score for the city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 46.2 hours per year, and the standard deviation is 6.16 hours per year.       The -score for a city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year is -0.68 standard deviations.       In a survey of 12 companies recruiting for recent college graduates, they reported the following numbers of job applicants per job posting:    123  123  134  127  115  122  125  101  130  143  110  122       Find the mean and standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z score for the company with 143 job applicants per job posting?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 122.9 job applicants per job posting, and the standard deviation is 10.91 job applicants per job posting.       The -score for a company with 143 job applicants per job posting is 1.84 standard deviations       You scored an 89 on a math test where the class mean and standard deviation are 75 points and 7 points respectively. You scored a 65 on an English test where the mean and standard deviation are 53 points and 4 points, respectively. In which class did you do better? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -score of my English test is greater than the -score of my math test, I did better on the English test than I did on the math test.    The mean running time for comedy movies is 139 minutes, with a standard deviation of 39.7 minutes. For action movies, the mean running time is 159 minutes, with a standard deviation of 26.2 minutes. A recent comedy movie had a running time of 102 minutes, while an action movie playing at the same theatre had a running time of 129 minutes. Which movie is shorter compared to other movies in the same genre? Explain your answer using Z-score.         Because the -score for the 129 minute action movie was less than the -score for the 102 comedy movie, the action movie was shorter than the comedy movie, when both movies are compared to other movies in their genres.    Poe, the Clydesdale horse has a world record breaking height of 20.2 hands. All Clydesdale horses have a mean height of 16.5 hands and a standard deviation of 1.85 hands. The last Great Dane to hold the world record for dog height was Gibson who was 107 cm tall. Great Danes have a mean height of 81 cm and a standard deviation of 13 cm. Which animal is taller compared to their respective breed? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -scores for the heights of Poe (the Clydesdale horse) and Gibson (the Great Dane) are the same, neither animal is taller than the other when compared to their respective breeds.    "

Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.  Similarly, looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died.

  "title": "The Normal Distribution",
  "body": " The Normal Distribution    Students will be able to:     Explain the properties of the Normal distribution    Calculate probabilities using the Empirical Rule    Calculate probabilities using technology    Calculate and interpret Z-scores    Calculate and interpret the bounds of a 95% confidence interval given the point estimate and the standard error      There is a pattern or shape that comes up frequently when graphing data called the Normal Distribution . You might be familiar with it as the bell curve . When we take measurements like the lengths of newborn babies or the weights of potato chip bags on an assembly line there are usually more measurements near the mean and fewer as we get further away from the mean on each side. We often see histograms with this shape:    A histogram where the bars form a bell shape. A Normal curve is overlaid on the histogram.    Notice how the shape is unimodal and symmetric with larger and smaller values getting less and less common as they get further from the mean. When we take samples from a population we might not get an exact Normal distribution but it is often close. We call this approximately Normal or nearly Normally distributed. The curve drawn over the histogram shows that the data are nearly Normal. Earlier in this chapter we learned about the mean , median and mode as measures of center and the standard deviation as a measure of variation or spread. The mean is often written with the greek letter mu, . The standard deviation is usualy represented by the lowercase Greek letter sigma, .    Properties of the Normal Distribution  Regardless of the data values, the Normal distribution has these properties:   The shape is unimodal and symmetric around the center.    The mean, median and mode are approximately the same value in the center.    Due to the symmetry, approximately 50% of the data values are below the mean, and approximately 50% of the data values are above the mean.    A normal curve with a line drawn in the middle to indicate the mean, median and mode. The drawing shows that 50% of the data values are below the line and 50% are above the line.      Almost all of the area under a Normal curve is within 3 standard deviations of the mean, so we use the standard deviation as our scale.    Data within two standard deviations of the mean are considered typical or usual. Data beyond two standard deviation are considered unusual. Data beyond 3 standard deviations are considered rare.     Now let's look at an example where we draw and label a Normal distribution given the mean and standard deviation All of the Normal drawings in this section were created with the online probability calculator at which is in the public domain. .   The test scores on a math quiz are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. Draw the Normal distribution and label the axis using the standard deviation.    A normal curve with the mean of 18 points labeled in the middle. To the right, 3 standard deviations are labeled 22, 26 and 30 points. To the left 3 standard deviations are labeled 14, 10 and 6 points.    We start by drawing a Normal curve and the horizontal axis. Then we place the mean of 18 points in the center of the graph and make 3 marks on each side, ending where the curve gets close to the axis.  Each mark represents one standard deviation. As we move to the right of the mean we will add the standard deviation of 4 points to get 22, 26 and 30 points. These are the values that are 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean.     Then we move to the left of the mean we subtract the standard deviation of 4 from 18 to get 14, 10 and 6 points. These are the values that are 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations below the mean.        The Empirical Rule  No matter what the mean and standard deviation are for a Normal Distribution, they always have the same shape or distribution of the data. We can describe this with the Empirical Rule which is also called the 68-95-99.7 Rule .  The numbers in the 68-95-99.7 rule describe the percentage of data or area within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Let's look at our previous example with scores on a math quiz that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points.   According to the Empirical rule, about 68% of all the data values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, or between 14 and 22 points.   A graph of a normal curve that shows 68% of the data values shaded within one standard deviation of the mean, in this case between 14 and 22 points.     About 95% of all the data values fall within two standard deviation, or between 10 and 26 points.   A graph of a normal curve that shows 95% of the data values shaded within two standard deviations of the mean, in this case between 10 and 26 points.     About 99.7% of all the data values fall within three standard deviations, or between 6 and 30 points.   A graph of a normal curve that show 99.7% of the data values shaded within 3 standard deviations of the mean, in this case between 6 and 30 points.    Now you can try this next example:    The weights of black lab dogs are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation of 7 pounds.   Draw and label a sketch of this distribution.    Use the Empirical Rule to complete following statements.   Approximately 68% of black labs weigh between and pounds.    Approximately 95% of black lab dogs weigh between and pounds.    Approximately 99.7% of black lab dogs weigh between and pounds.             We start by drawing the Normal curve and the horizontal axis, labeling 3 standard deviations on each side.   A normal curve labeled with 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92 and 99 pounds. The title of the graph is weights of black lab dogs in points.        Approximately 68% of black labs weigh between 71 and 85 pounds.    Approximately 95% of black labs weigh between 64 and 92 pounds.    Approximately 99.7% of black labs weigh between 57 and 99 points.            Using the Empirical Rule to Calculate Approximate Probabilities  Now that we have learned about the Empirical rule we can use it to find approximate probabilities. First we will calculate the percentage in each segment of the Normal distribution. Returning to our example of quiz scores with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points, we can divide the curve into segments by drawing a line at each standard deviation.    A normal curve labeled with 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 points. The title is quiz scores in points. There is a line segment at each number listed to divide the curve into segments.    Now, since we know that approximately 68% of the values are between 14 and 22 points, and the graph is symmetric, we divide 68% by 2 to get: So each of the middle 2 segments are 34% of the area each.  Next, we know that 95% of the values fall within 2 standard deviations or between 10 and 26 points. That also includes the 68% though, so to get the area of the next two segments, we subtract: Then since there is one segment on each side, we divide that by 2: So the next two segments from the mean are 13.5% each.  Continuing outward, 99.7% of the values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean or between 6 and 30 points. Since that includes the 95% we subtract: Then we divide that by 2: So the next two segments outward are 2.35% each.  Finally, there is one more set, since there is a tiny percentage outside of the 3 standard deviations. The total is 100% so we subtract: Then we divide that by 2: So the last two outer segments are 0.15% each.  We can summarize all the calculations in this drawing:    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in. From left to right the areas are 0.15%, 2.35%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.35%, 0.15%.    Now let's continue our quiz score example to see how to use the Empirical Rule to find probabilities.   For the quiz score data that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation 4 points, use the 68-95-99.7% rule to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of students earned scores between 22 and 30 points?    What percentage of students earned scores above 14 points?    What percentage of students earned a score below 14 or above 22 points?     Solution   Using the diagram above, we add the two segments between 22 and 30 to get . 15.8% percent of students earned scores between 22 and 30 points on the quiz.    We add all the segments above 14 to get . 84% of students earned scores above 14 points on the quiz.    We add all the segments below 14 and above 22 to get . 32% of students earned scores below 14 or above 22 points on the quiz. Notice we could have done this in a faster way by taking . There can be more than one way to get the answer.      Now you can try one with this next example.    Continuing with the black lab dogs whose weights are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation 7 pounds, use the 68-95-99.7% rule to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of black labs weigh between 78 and 92 pounds?    What percentage of black labs weigh below 71 points?    What percentage of black labs weigh below 64 or above 78 points?       First we need to draw this distribution and label three standard deviations on each side of the mean to determine where these weights fall. That will tell us which segments to add up. Here is our drawing of this distribution from before.   The previous normal curve of weights of black lab dogs in pounds. The scale at the bottom is 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, 99 pounds.      Using this Normal curve along with the diagram above we see we need to add the two segments between 78 and 92 pounds to get . 47.5% percent of black labs weigh between 78 and 92 pounds.    We add all the segments below 71 pounds to get . 16% of black labs weigh below 71 pounds.    We add all the segments below 64 and above 78 pounds to get . 52.5% of black labs weigh below 64 or above 78 pounds. Notice we could have done this in a faster way since 78 is the mean we know the percentage above the mean is 50%. We could have added .         Using Technology to Calculate Exact Probabilities  The Empirical rule is used to find approximate probabilities and it only works if the number is one of the labels on our scale. We usually want to calculate an exact answer with any value. We will use technology to calculate probabilities with two different methods: Onlinestatbook.com and spreadsheets . Check with your class notes or instructor on which technology to use.   To use Onlinestatbook.com, go to the OnlineStatbook Normal calculator and enter the mean and standard deviation. Then select the option that matches the probability you want to find: Above, Below, Between or Outside and enter the probability you want to find. Then click on the Recalculate button.   A screenshot of the onlinestatbook.com normal probability calculator. It shows a normal curve, an input box for the mean and median, and a choice to find above, below, between or outside.    To use a spreadsheet, we will use the spreadsheet formula   =NORM.DIST(value, mean, standard deviation, cumulative)   This function always gives the probability to the left of a number or . We can use this formula to find greater than, between and outside probabilities as well. Here are the commands we will use and we will explain them in the next example with visuals.    Probability  Spreadsheet Formula    Below  =NORM.DIST(value, mean, SD, 1)    Above  =1-NORM.DIST(value, mean, SD,1)    Between  =NORM.DIST(upper_value, mean, SD, 1)-Norm.Dist(lower_value, mean, SD, 1)    Outside  =NORM.DIST(lower_value, mean, SD, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(upper_value,mean, SD, 1)     For the quiz score data that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation 4 points, use technology to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of students earned a score below 12 points?    What percentage of students earned scores above 27 points?    What percentage of students earned scores between 21 and 25 points?    What percentage of students earned scores less than 11 or more than 23?     Solution     First, using OnlineStatbook, we we will enter the mean of 18 points and the standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Below and enter 12. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .  To use a spreadsheet, we enter =NORM.DIST(12, 18, 4, 1) . The last value is always a 1 to indicate that we want a cumulative probability or area. This also gives us a result of or .    A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.        To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Above and enter 27. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .  To use a spreadsheet, NORM.DIST gives us the area to the left so if we want the area to the right we need to find the complement or subtract from 1. We enter =1-NORM.DIST(27, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .    A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.       To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Between and enter 21 and 25. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .   A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.    To use a spreadsheet, we need to use NORM.DIST twice. We can find the area to the left of the upper value and then subtract the area to the left of the lower value. That will give us the area between the two values. We enter =NORM.DIST(25, 18, 4, 1)-NORM.DIST(21, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .     To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Outside and enter 11 and 23. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .   A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.    To use a spreadsheet, we will find the left and right probabilities and add them together. We enter =NORM.DIST(11, 18, 4, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(23, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .      Now you can this try this example.    Continuing with the black lab dogs whose weights are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation 7 pounds, use technology to calculate the following probabilities:     The probability that a randomly chosen black lab weighs at least 95 pounds.    The probability that a randomly chosen black lab weighs less than 72 pounds.    The probability that a black lab weighs less than 65 pounds or greater than 86 pounds.    The probability that a black lab weighs between 66 and 75.          Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =1-NORM.DIST(95, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(72, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(65, 78, 7, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(86, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(75, 78, 7, 1)-NORM.DIST(66, 78, 7, 1) we get or .         The Standard Normal Distribution and Z-Scores  Earlier in the chapter we learned how to calculate a Z-score , which is a way to determine how usual or unusual a data value is, or compare values from two different distributions. To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we calculate its distance from the mean. Then we divide that distance by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide.   If a data value is equal to the mean it will have a Z-score of 0. If a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, it will have a Z-score of 1. We can make a Normal distribution of Z-scores and it will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is called the Standard Normal distribution , shown below.    A normal curve labeled with -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 standard deviations. The title is Z-scores. There is a line at each number dividing the curve into segments.    Applying the Empirical Rule in percentage form to the Standard Normal curve looks like this.    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in. From left to right the areas are 0.15%, 2.35%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.35%, 0.15%.    Sometimes we may want to use the decimal form of the numbers instead.    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in in decimal form. From left to right the areas are 0.0015, 0.0235, 0.135, 0.34, 0.34, 0.135, 0.0235, 0.0015.    Applying the Empirical Rule to the Standard Normal distribution, we know that 68% of all Z-scores will be between -1 and 1, 95% of all Z-scores will be between -2 and 2 and 99.7% of all Z-scores will be between -3 and 3. A Z-score below -3 or above 3 is possible, but is very unlikely.   Let's say a student scored 27 points on the math quiz where the scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. We know from our earlier drawing that they scored between 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean. Let's calculate the Z-score to determine exactly how many standard deviations from the mean they scored.  First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . The Z-score is positive so which confirms that they scored above the mean.     Now you can calculate the Z-score for a student who scored 15 on the math quiz.    First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . This student scored 0.75 standard deviations below the mean. The Z-score is negative which means they scored below the mean.      Confidence Intervals and Margin of Error  Now that we have learned more about the Normal distribution, we can come back to confidence intervals which we studied in section 3.1. When we take a sample, our goal is to infer our statistic to the larger population. Let's say we wanted to know the average height of all 10-year-old kids living in the United States. It would take too much time and money to measure them all so we take a random sample that is representative of the population of 10-year-olds.  If we measured 25 randomly selected 10-year-olds and calculated the sample mean of 54.5 inches, that statistic is called a point estimate . It is a single value that we got from a sample. However, if we measured another random sample of 25 different kids we would likely get a different mean. That is called sampling variation or sampling error. To be more accurate in our estimation of the height of all 10-year olds we give a range of values called a confidence interval .  To construct a confidence interval we need to know the point estimate, the standard error of the data and the desired confidence level. The standard error is an estimate for the standard deviation that we calculate from the sample data and the sample size. You can learn more details about sampling distributions, why they are Normally distributed and how to calculate the standard error in a statistics course.  The most common confidence level is the 95% confidence level. The 95% confidence interval represents the middle 95% of the Normal curve. From the Empirical rule we saw that approximately 95% of the data values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Using more exact methods, the middle 95% is 1.96 standard deviations from the mean.    A normal curve showing the middle 95% of the area shaded, which is 1.96 standard deviations on each side of the mean of 0.    Let's say that our point estimate for the height of 10-year-olds is 54.5 inches and the standard error is 1.75 inches. To estimate the middle 95% of values we multiply the standard error by 1.96 standard deviations.     To find the lower boundary of the confidence interval we subtract   To find the upper boundary of the confidence interval add .  The 95% confidence interval is 51.07 to 57.93 inches or (51.07, 57.93) inches.  To interpret a confidence interval we say: We are 95% confident that the true average height of all 10-year-olds is between 51.07 and 57.93 inches. This means if repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, about 95% of the intervals would contain the true population mean. About five percent of the intervals would not contain the population mean.  The standard error multiplied by the number of standard deviations for the confidence level is called the margin of error . In this example we have  . The margin of error is the range of values below and above your sample mean in the confidence interval.  Since the point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter, it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value. The standard error, which is the measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval. When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as Normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest. We can be 95% confident this interval captures the true value.  The idea behind confidence intervals and margin of error is that any survey, study or poll will always be different from the population because samples vary. The confidence interval and margin of error reflect the sample size and the variation in the sample.    Exercises   Describe the shape of a Normal distribution.   The shape of a Normal distribution is unimodal, symmetric and bell-shaped.    In a Normal distribution, what percentage of observations will lie to the left of the mean?   50% of the observations will be below the mean.

The median tree diameter is approximately 35 inches.    Two Normal distributions have the same means but different standard deviations. Distribution A has a standard deviation of 10 inches, and distribution B has a standard deviation of 15 inches. Which curve has a wider spread along the horizontal axis? Why?   Distribution B has a wider spread because it has a larger standard deviation.     Use the Empirical Rule to answer these questions.

  "body": " Fundamentals of Probability    Dice used in gambling   Two dice on a green craps table    Probability is the chance or likelihood that something will occur.     Studends will be able to     Identify outcomes, events, and the sample space for an experiment.    Calculate basic probability.    Calculate the probability of the complement of an event.    Calculate probabilities involving \"and\" and \"or\".      Basic Probability  We will start by defining some important terminology.   Terminology     Experiment  An experiment is a repeatable procedure or test being done. Common examples are flipping a coin, rolling a pair of dice, drawing a playing card from a deck, or taking a COVID test.    Outcome  An outcome is one possible result of an experiment. When drawing a playing card from a deck, one possible outcome is drawing the Queen of Spades. Another outcome is drawing the Two of Diamonds.    Event  An event is a particular outcome or set of outcomes. When rolling a pair of dice, one event is rolling \"doubles\", meaning that the same value is shown on both dice. (There are six different outcomes that make up this event.) Another event could be rolling a total of two.    Sample Space  The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. When flipping a coin, the sample space consists of the two possible outcomes: Heads and Tails. We would write that as .    Probability  The probability of an event is the likelihood that it will occur, usually expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. When flipping a coin, the probability of flipping heads is 50%.      While probability theory has far-reaching applications in such fields as medicine, business, politics, and science, we will focus mostly on applications in games and gambling because less background knowledge is required to understand them. In particular, we will take many examples from games involving cards, spinners, and dice.  Consider the experiment of flipping a coin three times. We can denote, for example, the outcome of getting heads on the first flip, tails on the second flip, and tails on the third flip as . Using this notation, the sample space can be written as follows:   The event of rolling at least two tails is .  There are four outcomes in which we get at least two tails out of the total of eight possible outcomes. Assuming it is a fair coin, meaning that all of the outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of the event , which we write using function notation is:     Consider the experiment: rolling a single standard six-sided die. (Die the singular of dice, so we can have one die or two or more dice.)   What is the sample space, and how many outcomes are in the sample space?    What outcomes are in the event \"rolling a three\", and how many outcomes are in that event?    What is the probability of the event \"rolling a prime number\"?          The sample space is There are six outcomes in the sample space.    The event \"rolling a three\" is There is just one outcome in event .    The probability of rolling a three is          Consider a game involving the spinner below.   Spinner with thirty percent dark blue, twenty percent light blue, ten percent green, and forty percent orange   Find the probability of spinning dark blue or green.         Did you notice the difference between the coin and dice examples and the spinner example? Because the sizes of each color wedge in the spinner are different, they have different probabilities. However, provided the coins and dice are fair, there is an equally likely chance of each outcome. On average, we should flip heads half the time and tails the other half. When rolling a single die, we should roll each number approximately one sixth of the time.  When all outcomes are equally likely, probability can be calculated as the number of ways what you are looking for occurs divided by the total number of things that can occur. A more formal definition follows.   Probability Involving Equally-likely Outcomes  If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability that event occurs is equal to the proportion of outcomes in the sample space corresponding to event .      Let's say you have a bag with 40 truffles, 28 dark chocolate and 14 milk chocolate. If you pick a truffle at random, what is the probability that it will be dark chocolate?    Because we are picking a cherry at random, we may assume that all outcomes (truffles) are equally likely, so we may use the basic probability formula.  It isn't necessary to write sets for the sample space and the event because we already know how many items are in each, although writing the sets would not be a problem.  The probability of picking a dark chocolate truffle is   We can simplify to . It would also be correct to express the probability as 0.7 or 70%.    What if someone asked you to find the probability of rolling a seven on a standard six-sided die? Since there isn't a seven on a standard die, this event is impossible, so its probability is zero. Mathematically, that is   On the other extreme, the probability of rolling a one, two, three, four, five, or six is . In words, there is a one hundred percent chance of rolling one of the six possible outcomes.   Probability of Impossible and Certain Events  If an event is impossible, its probability is zero, and if an event is guaranteed, its probability is one or 100%.   All other events have probabilities between zero and one.   If you obtain a probability that is negative or greater than one, check your work there is a mistake somewhere.    Cards  A standard American deck of playing cards consists of four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). Spades and clubs are black; hearts and diamonds are red.  Each suit contains 13 cards, each of a different rank:   An Ace (A),which may be considered a low card, a high card, or both, depending on the game,    One each of cards numbered two through ten,    A Jack (J),    A Queen (Q), and    A King (K).     Jacks, queens, and kings are considered face cards , and jacks, queens, kings, and aces are considered picture cards .  There are a total of 52 cards in the standard deck.  Some games make use of two extra cards, called jokers , which may be considered wild cards .     Find the probability of getting an ace when drawing a single card from a standard 52-card deck.    There is one ace in each of the four suits, so there are four aces in the deck out of the 52 total cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace is       Find the probability of getting a black face card when drawing a single card from a standard deck.    There are three face cards of each suit, and two of the suits are black. So, there are six black face cards, and the probability of drawing one of them is or approximately 11.54%.     Dice  Many board games use two dice, each with six sides. Each side has a different number of dots: one through six.  The sample space for the 36 possible outcomes of rolling two dice is shown in the grid below. In each ordered pair, the first component represents the number of dots shown on the first die and the second component represents the number of dots shown on the second die.   Dice outcomes listed in rows: (1,1) through (1,6), (2,1) through (2,6), and so on.      When rolling two dice, if both show the same number it is called \"doubles\". What is the probability of rolling doubles?    There are six ways to roll doubles, through , out of the total of 36 possible outcomes. The probability is       What is the probability of getting a sum greater than eight when rolling two dice?    There are four ways to obtain a sum of nine: , , , and .  There are three ways to obtain a sum of ten: , , and .  There are two ways to obtain a sum of eleven: and .  There is one way to obtain a sum of twelve, which is the greatest possible sum: .  (Did you notice that entries with the same sum are aligned along diagonals of the sample space grid?)  All together, there are 10 ways to obtain a sum greater than eight. Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum greater than eight is or about 27.78%.      Probability of \"And\" and \"Or\" Events  In mathematics, we use the words \"and\" and \"or\" in a very particular way.   \"And\"  Let and be two events. Then the event \" and \" is written .  It is the intersection (or overlap) of and , meaning both must be true.   For example when rolling a single die, suppose is the event of rolling a prime number and is the event of rolling an odd. Then is the event of rolling a number that is both prime and odd.   Or  Let and be two events. Then the event \" or \" is written .  It is the union (or compilation) of and , meaning either or or both must be true.   If is the event of rolling a prime number and is the event of rolling an odd, then is the event of rolling a number that is either prime or odd (or both).    In the experiment of drawing a single card from a standard deck, event is \"drawing a seven\" and event is \"drawing a heart\". How many elements are in the events and ?    Event consists of the sevens that are also hearts. There is only one seven of hearts, so there is one element in .  Event consists of all the sevens and all the hearts. There are four sevens and 13 hearts, but we need to be careful not to count the seven of hearts twice.  We can say that there are four sevens, which includes the seven of hearts, and 12 additional hearts for a total of 16 elements in event .    To find the total number of cards that are sevens or hearts, we added the number of sevens plus the number of hearts that are not sevens. Another way to think about this is adding the number of sevens plus the number of hearts and subtracting the intersection which is one card: the seven of hearts. That would give us cards. In general, the number of outcomes in event is equal to the number of outcomes in plus the number of outcomes in minus the number of outcomes in .  we can generalize this approach to write a formula for the probability of an \"or\" event.   Probability of A or B  We have two equivalent methods to calculate the probability of an \"or\" event:       An outreach program for STEM majors a college is open to female students and first-generation students, which are students who are the first in their families to go to college. If 53% of the students at the college are female, 38% of the students are first-generation, and 17% are female first-generation students, what percentage of students are eligible for the program?    Let be the event that a student is female and let be the event that a student is a first-generation student.  We are given that , , and   We are looking for the percentage of students who are female or first-generation, or , which we can find using the formula. Therefore, 74% of students are eligible for the program.      Contingency Tables  A contingency table summarizes all the possible combinations for two categorical variables. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of outcomes occurs. For example, suppose we randomly select 250 households from the greater Portland area and ask whether they have a cat and whether they have a dog. In this case, have a cat and have a dog are the two variables, and each variable has two categories: Yes and No. To create the contingency table, we make columns for the categories of one variable, and rows for the categories of the other variable. We also add a row and column for the subtotals of each category. Each cell of the resulting table contains the number of outcomes having the characteristics of the intersecting row and column categories. For our dog and cat example, the table would look like this:     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  Yes Cat and Yes Dog  Yes Cat and No Dog  Yes Cat Total    No Cat  No Cat and Yes Dog  No Cat and No Dog  No Cat Total    Total  Yes Dog Total  No Dog Total  Grand total    Suppose that of the 250 households surveyed, 180 said they have a cat, 95 said they have a dog, and 52 said they have both a cat and a dog. We can use this information to fill in the cells of the table.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52   180    No Cat       Total  95   250    The first cell we can fill in is the grand total , which is the total number of subjects in the study. In this case, there are 250 households participating in the survey. The next two cells we can fill in are the total number of households that have a cat, 180, and the total number of households that have a dog, 95. The final cell we can fill in from the given information is the intersection of the having a dog column and a having a cat row, which is 52 households.  Since each row and column must sum to their totals, we can use subtraction to find the missing numbers as shown below.

The total row and the total column also add to the grand total as shown in the right table.

Note, for example that there are 52 respondents out of the grand total 250 who own both a cat and a dog. So, the probability that a respondent selected at random has both a dog and a cat is where is the event that the respondent owns a dog and is the event that the respondent owns a cat.  Similarly, the probability that a respondent owns a cat or a dog is     The contingency table shows the survival data for passengers and crew aboard the Titanic.

What percent of the people aboard the Titanic were members of the crew?    What is the probability that a person selected at random from the ship's manifest (list of all aboard) is a first class passenger who survived?    What is the probability that a person selected at random from the ship's manifest was a first class passenger or survived?          A total of 1490 out of the 2201 people aboard did not survive. That is of those aboard who lost their lives.    There were 885 crew, which is     Of the 2201 people aboard, 203 were first class passengers who survived. The resulting probability is     Putting together the 711 survivors plus the remaining 122 first class passengers who did not survive gives us a total of 833 people who were first class or survived. Another approach to find this total is to add all the values, excluding totals, in the survive row and the first class column to get people who were first class or survivors or both.  Therefore, the probability is          Complementary Events  In the previous example, we found that 74% of students at a particular college are eligible for an outreach program. We could quickly determine the percentage of students who are not eligible by subtracting from 100% to find that 36% are not eligible.  The two events, \"being eligible for the program\" and \"not being eligible for the program\", are complementary , meaning that together they complete the full list or full complement of possible outcomes. For two events to be complementary, it is also necessary that they cannot occur at the same time.  We will see situations later in this chapter where it is significantly easier to calculate the probability that something doesn't happen than the probability that it does. We will use the strategy of first finding the probability that the event doesn't happen and then subtracting from one or 100%.    Find the probability of getting a sum of less than 11 when rolling two dice.    Looking at the table in , we see that there are three ways to obtain a sum of 11 or higher, which is the complement of the event we are interested in. This means that there must be ways to obtain a sum less than 11.  Therefore   Note that this computation is equivalent to because .     Complementary Events  The commplement of event , written is the event that does not happen.  We read as \" bar\" or \"not \".   or         If you draw a card at random from a standard deck, what is the probability that it is not a diamond?    The probability that the card is a diamond is .  Thus the probability that the card is not a diamond is .       Find the probability of rolling a one or a six when a six-sided die is rolled.        Find the probability of getting a number less than five when a six-sided die is rolled.        Find the probability of getting a sum less than five when a pair of standard dice are rolled.

Find the probability that it is brown.   \\frac{4}{7}    In an experiment, a coin is flipped and a standard die is rolled. Write the sample space.   Using the notation of for the outcome of heads on the coin and a one on the die, the sample space is:     Consider an experiment where four coins are flipped.   List the outcomes in the sample space. (There should be 16 outcomes.)    List the outcomes in the event that at least two coins show tails.    Find the probability that at least two coins show tails.                         In the casino game of roulette, a ball is dropped into a spinning wheel. Gamblers win or lose varying amounts based on where it stops. The wheel contains numbers 0, 00, and 1-36. Both 0 and 00 are green, half of the number 1-36 are red and the other half are black. Assuming that all outcomes are equally likely, find the probability of each outcome.   The ball lands on a red number.    The ball lands on a green number.    The ball lands on the 14.

  "body": " Conditional Probability    Students will be able to:     Calculate percentages and probabilities using a contingency table.    Calculate conditional probability.    Determine whether two events are independent.    Calculate probabilities of independent and dependent events.      When we looked at categorical data in the previous chapter, it was related to a single variable, or characteristic of interest, such as favorite movie or car color. To illustrate the data, we made a frequency table and used it to create a pie chart or bar chart. But what if we want to illustrate the relationship between two categorical variables? To do this, we can use a contingency table.    Conditional Probability  Another question we can answer using a contingency table is what percentage of dog owning households also own a cat? In this case the group that we are interested in isn't every household surveyed (the grand total), but just those households that own a dog.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250    We call this a conditional statement because we are only considering the households with a certain condition. If we focus on the column representing the households that own a dog, we see that there is a total of 95 households with a dog, and that 52 of those 95 households also have a cat. Therefore, or approximately 54.7% of the households with a dog also have a cat. Another way to phrase this conditional statement is, What percent of households have a cat given they have a dog. You will see the word given quite a bit in this chapter and that makes the denominator change.  If is the event \"owning a cat\" and is the event \"owning a dog\", then the probability that someone owns a cat given that you know they own a dog is written    Conditional Probability   is the probability that event occurs given that event occurs or occurred.   or   This is called conditional probability and can be interpreted as the probability of with the condition or prior knowledge of .     Find the probability that a card drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck is a king given that it is a face card.    In this situation, we already know that the card drawn is one of the 12 face cards. Of those, four are kings. Therefore, the probability is       Suppose that two cards are drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck without replacement. (This means that the cards are not put back into the deck after being drawn.)   Find the probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card also is a heart.    Find the probability that the second card is a heart given that the first card is not a heart.          A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards, thirteen of which are hearts. If the first card draws is a heart, then the total number of cards drops to 51 and the total number of hearts drops to twelve. Therefore,     If the first card is not a heart, then all thirteen hearts still remain in the deck. Therefore,          Two dice are rolled. Find the probability that the second die shows a 5 given that the first die shows a 5.    This is something of a trick question because the outcome of the first die is unrelated to the outcome of the second die. The probability that the second die shows a 5 is regardless of what the first die shows.      Independent and Dependent Events  Two or more events are called dependent if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other(s). For example, the probability that a second card drawn from a deck (without replacement) is a heart depends on whether the first card drawn was a heart.  Two or more events are called independent if the occurrence of one has not affect on the the probability of the other(s). For example, the probability that a second die rolled shows a 5 is independent of the result of the first die.    Determine whether each pair of events is independent or dependent.   A jar has ten blue marbles and four white marbles. Two marbles are drawn with replacement. (This means that after the first marble is drawn, it is put back in the jar before the second marble is drawn.) Event is \"the first marble is white\", and event is \"the second marble is white\".    A jar has ten blue marbles and four white marbles. Two marbles are drawn without replacement. (This means that after the first marble is drawn, it is not put back in the jar.) Event is \"the first marble is white\", and event is \"the second marble is white\".    Three coins are flipped. Event is \"the first coin shows heads\", event is \"the second coin shows heads\", and event is \"the third coin shows tails\".          Independent    Dependent    Independent        Probability of Independent Events  If events and are independent, then   If then events and are independent.  If then the events and are dependent.     To determine which online advertisement is more effective, an online retailer conducted an A\/B test. Some visitors to a particular social media platform were showed the original advertisement while the others were shown a new advertisement. Then the viewers were tracked to determine whether they subsequently made a purchase from the retailer. The results are shown in the table.     Original Ad  New Ad  Total    Made Purchase  120  320  440    No Purchase  972  617  1589    Total  1092  937  2029    Are the events \"viewed the new advertisement\" and \"made a purchase\" dependent?    We will calculate is the same as .      Since the two probabilities are different, we can conclude that the events are dependent.  We also could observe that , and, therefore, the new advertisement appears to be more effective than the original advertisement.      A survey of licensed drivers asked whether they had received a speeding ticket in the last year and whether their car is red. The results of the survey are shown in the contingency table to the right.     Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    Determine whether the events \"driving a red car\" and \"received a speeding ticket\" are dependent or independent, if possible, and state what that means. The margin of error is three percentage points.    Let be the event \"driving a red car\", and let be the event \"received a speeding ticket\". We will calculate and and determine whether the difference is greater than the margin of error.      Since the two probabilities differ by 1% which is within the margin of error, we cannot conclude that driving a red car and getting a speeding ticket are dependent.      Probability of Sequential Events  Consider the experiment of selecting two marbles from a jar without replacement. The jar initially contains two green marbles, which we will call G1 and G2, and two blue marbles, which we will call B1 and B2. Using methods from , we can find the probability that both marbles are blue as follows.  Using the notation that (B1,G2) represents drawing blue marble B1 followed by green marble G2, we write the sample space.   There are twelve elements in the sample space. We are interested in the event that both marbles are blue, Therefore the probability is   Isn't there a more efficient way to find this probability? Yes, there is!  The probability that the first marble is blue is because two out of the four marbles are blue. Now, assuming that the first marble was blue, there will be three marbles left in the jar, only one of which is blue. The probability that the second marble also is blue is   The probability that both marbles are blue is the product of these two probabilities!   The probability of two or more events in sequence is the the product of the probability that the first event occurs and the probability that the second event occurs given or assuming that the first event occurred.   Probability of Sequential Events  For any events and :   If and are independent , we can simplify to:   For three or more events, we use additional factors as needed.   We will investigate why this rule works later in the chapter.    Four cards are drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck without replacement . Find the probability that all four are hearts.    The solution is the product of , , , and        Four cards are drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck with replacement . This means that each card is replaced in the deck before the next is drawn. Find the probability that all four are hearts.    The solution is the product of , , , and   However, in this situation, all four probabilities are the same because the cards are replaced. The events are independent!       Consider the experiment of flipping a coin five times.   Find the probability that all five flips result in heads.    Find the probability that at least one flip results in tails.          Each coin flip is an independent event with probability of heads . Therefore, the probability that all five flips result in heads is     Instead of calculating the probability of getting at least one tails directly, which would be quite onerous, we make use of the fact that \"at least one tails\" is the complement of \"all heads\". Therefore, we need only subtract our previous answer from one. On average, if we repeated this experiment, we can expect to see all five heads once out of every 32 times, and we can expect to see at least one tails the other 31 out of 32 times.

Yes, it does appear that survival depended on the passenger's class. The probability of survival for first class passengers is significantly greater than the probability of survival for second class passengers and is more than double the probability of survival for third class passengers.

  "title": "Expected Value",
  "body": " Expected Value    Students will be able to:     Make a probability model    Calculate the expected value for a probability model    Determine whether a game is fair      Expected value is one of the useful probability concept we will discuss. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's one thing that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries may hope most people never learn about.    Expected Value  The expected value is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure is repeated many times. To help get a better understanding of what expected value is and how it is used, consider the following scenario:  You are commissioned to design a game for a local carnival. Your proposed game will have players roll a six-sided die. If it comes up 6, they win $10. If not, they get to roll again. If they get a 6 on the second roll, then they win 3. If they do not get a 6 on the second roll, they lose. With the game design complete, you now need to decide how much the carnival game owner should charge players in order to make a profit over the long run.  To make a profit, the carnival needs to know how much they will pay in winnings, on average, over the long run and charge more than that. In other words, they must charge more than the expected value of the game.  One way to organize the outcomes and probabilities is with a probability model. A probability model or probability distribution is a table listing the possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. The outcomes will be the amounts a player can win, and we will calculate the probabilities using what we have learned about theoretical probability.  As we have seen with complements, probabilities in a probability distribution must add to 1, so that is important to check. Here is the probability model for the carnival game:    Outcome ($ won)  Rolling Event  Probability    $10  Roll a 6 on the first roll     $3  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll     $0  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and not a 6 on the second roll     Think of the expected value as a weighted average. We could take the average of $10, $3, and $0, but they are not all equally likely. It is much more likely to win $0 than to win $10. So, to find the average, we multiply each outcome by the chance it will happen and add the products together.   Expected Value  Multiply each outcome by its probability and add up the products   In this case we have:     This tells us that over the long run, players can expect to win $2.08 per game. This also means that the carnival owner will be paying out an average of $2.08 per game! Since the carnival owner would rather not lose money by paying players over the long run we need to make sure to charge players enough to offset the average payout.  If the carnival owner charges exactly $2.08 to play, the game is considered a fair game since the expected winnings would be $0. In a fair game, the player isn't expected to win anything, nor is the owner expected to earn anything over the long run. However, if the carnival owner charges the player more than $2.08 to play, they will earn money over the long run.  Suppose you suggest charging $5 to play. We can determine the net winnings by subtracting the $5 the player has to pay from their expected winnings. This gives us:     This means that over the long run, players can expect to lose an average of $2.92 each game they play, and the carnival owner can expect to earn an average of $2.92 per game over the long run. Here's another example.    Pick4 is a game by the Oregon Lottery that costs $1 to play. In this game you pick 4 numbers in a specific pattern. If you get the exact sequence, you can in theory earn a lot of money. Suppose that the payouts are as follows. Determine the player's expected net winnings.    Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500       This table is not quite a complete probability distribution since it is missing one important outcome: when the player loses. In that case the prize is $0. We need to add a line for this. The prize for this missing outcome is $0, and since losing is the complement to winning something , the probability will be:      Adding this information to the table gives a complete probability distribution. Now we can see that players are going to lose more than 99% of the time, so the expected value will be heavily weighted toward winning $0.    Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500     $0  0.9961       Therefore, the player's expected winnings are $2.07, on average, over the long run. To find the expected net winnings, we subtract the cost to play. Since it costs $1 to play,     Assuming the given payouts are correct, this would be one game you would want to play for investment purposes since you can expect to earn $1.07 per game, on average, over the long run. Play a million times, and you just might become a millionaire!    In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play, since in the long run you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money.  Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is always negative for the player, and therefore positive for the casino. It must be positive for the casino, or they would go out of business! Players just need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, they should expect to lose money. That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost, but it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.     19th century roulette wheel   Wooden roulette wheel with alternately red and black numbers 1 through 36 and green numbers 0, and 00.    In the casino game of roulette, a ball is dropped into a spinning wheel. Gamblers win or lose varying amounts based on where it stops.          Expected value is not only used to determine the average amount won and lost at casinos and carnivals, it also has applications in business and insurance, just to name a few. Let's look at a couple of those applications.    For 3 months, a coffee shop tracked their morning sales of coffee, between 6am and 10am. The following results were recorded:    Number of cups sold  145  150  155  160  170    Probability  0.15  0.22  0.37  0.19  0.07    How many cups of coffee should they expect to sell each morning?    In this case the table tells us that 15% of the time they sell 145 cups of coffee between 6am and 10am, 22% of the time they sell 150 cups, 37% of the time they sell 155 cups, 19% of the time they sell 160 cups, and 7% of the time they sell 170 cups. Since the highest probability is associated with 155 cups, the expected value should lie somewhat close to this.  To find the expected number of coffees sold, we multiply each number of cups of coffee by its respective probability and then add the products.       This means that over the long run, the coffee shop can expect, on average, to sell around 154 cups of coffee each morning. This is an important tool for businesses since it helps inform them how much stock they should keep on hand.      On average, a 40-year-old man in the US has a 0.242% chance of dying in the next year According to the estimator at . An insurance company charges $275 annually for a life insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the insurance company on this policy?    The first thing we want to do is organize the probabilities and outcomes in a probability distribution table. There are two outcomes – either the policy holder dies, and the insurance company pays the benefit, or the policy holder does not die, and they do not pay anything.  The probability of paying the death benefit is equal to the chance of the person dying in the next year, and the probability of paying nothing is equal to the complement of the chance of dying in the next year.    Insurance payout  Probability    $100000  0.00242    $0  1-0.00242=0.99758    Then we can calculate:     So, the expected payout for the insurance company is $242, but they are charging $275 for the policy. Their net revenue would be     The insurance company is making, on average, $33 per policy per year. It shouldn't be too surprising because there are overhead costs and the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if they, on average, make money on them. But how much money should they make? As a consumer it is important to know about expected value.      Exercises   A bag contains 3 gold marbles, 6 silver marbles, and 28 black marbles.

A company wants to offer a 2-year extended warranty in case their product fails after the original warranty period but within 2 years of the purchase. They estimate that 0.7% of their products will fail during that time, and it will cost them $350 to replace a failed product. If they charge $48 for the extended warranty, what is the company's expected profit or loss on each warranty sold?   The company's expected profit is $45.55 per warranty sold.    A company wants to offer a 3-year extended warranty in case their product fails after the original warranty period but within 3 years of the purchase. They estimate that 0.5% of their products will fail during that time, and it will cost them $400 to replace a failed product. If they charge $60 for the extended warranty, what is the company's expected profit or loss on each warranty sold?   The company's expected profit is $58 per warranty sold.    An insurance company estimates the probability of an earthquake in the next year to be 0.0013. The average damage done by an earthquake it estimates to be $60,000. If the company offers earthquake insurance for $100, what is their expected value of the policy?   The company's expected value on each policy is $22 which means they will make $22, on average, per policy sold.    An insurance company estimates the probability of a flood in the next year to be 0.0002. The average damage done by a flood is estimated to be $70,000. If the company offers flood insurance for $3000, what is their expected value of the policy?   The company's expected value on each policy is $2,986 which means they will make $2,986, on average, per policy sold.    You purchase a raffle ticket to help out a charity.

For example, Tasha, Lupe, and Helena, all voted in the same way, HAO. So, we will list that combination once, with the number 3 at the top of that column. Three students also voted for AHO, and OHA. One student voted for the ranking AOH. Below is the preference schedule.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O    Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can see the total number of votes cast: total votes.     Plurality Method  The voting method you may be most familiar with in the United States is the plurality method . In the plurality method, the candidate with the most first-choice votes is declared the winner.  There is a difference between a majority and a plurality. For a majority, a candidate must have over 50% of the votes. There are some states that require a majority in order to win an election. In more cases, though, only a plurality is required, which means having more votes than any other candidate. If a tie occurs without using ranked choice voting, then a new run-off election would be required.    In our election from above, we had this preference table:    Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O    For the plurality method, we only look at the 1st choice row. Totaling them up:   Ana: votes    Omar: votes    Helena: votes     Ana is the winner using the plurality voting method.  Notice that Ana won with 4 out of 10 votes, or 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the votes, but not a majority.      How Many Votes are Needed to Win?  If we know how many voters there are, we can calculate the minimum number of votes needed for a majority win.  Continuing from above, there are 10 voters, so we divide that by 2 or multiply by 0.5 to find 50%. Then we use the next whole number to get just over 50%.   . Then we add one and get 6 votes.  Exactly half of the votes would be a tie, so we go to the next whole number. A candidate would need 6 out of 10 votes to win a majority. If there was an odd number of voters we would divide by 2 and get a decimal. Let's say there were 13 voters:   . Then we go to the next whole number and get 7 votes. Votes have to be a whole number and rounding a decimal up also gives us just over 50%.  Whether we end up with a decimal or not, we always use the next whole number after dividing by 2.  A candidate can win a plurality with fewer votes than the majority, as long as they have more than any other candidate. It depends on the rule for a particular election.    Insincere Voting  In a system with only two major political parties like the United States, it can be nearly impossible for third-party candidates to break through. You may feel like you would be wasting your vote if you voted for a third-party candidate. Consider this example.    Here is a two-party election with preferences shown below. It is a close race, but candidate B would win.    Number of voters  96  100    1st choice  A  B    2nd choice  B  A    Suppose a third candidate, C, entered the race, and a segment of voters sincerely want to vote for that third candidate. Here is the new preference schedule.    Number of voters  96  90  10    1st choice  A  B  C    2nd choice  B  A  B    3rd choice  C  C  A    The ten people who prefer candidate C are in a bind because if they vote for C, then A will win, but they prefer B over A. It is likely that they will vote for B, their second choice, to keep A from winning.    Situations like this can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is when a person doesn't vote according to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, a person who wants to vote for a third-party candidate realizes it would take a vote away from their major party candidate. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, they vote for the major party candidate.    Instant Runoff Method  The Instant Runoff Method is a modification of the plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.  The voting is done with ranked choice ballots and a preference schedule is generated. Then we tally all the first-choice votes. The candidate with the least first-place votes is eliminated, but any votes for that candidate are transferred to the voters' next choice. The process continues until one candidate has a majority. We will show you how it works with an example.    Consider the preference schedule below, in which a committee is choosing a chairperson. The candidates are labeled A, B, C, D, and E for simplicity. Here is the preference schedule:    Number of voters  3  5  1  5  7  2  1    1st choice  B  C  C  B  D  A  E    2nd choice  C  A  B  D  C  E  D    3rd choice  A  E  B  C  A  B  B    4th choice  D  D  E  A  E  C  A    5th choice  E  B  A  E  B  D  C    Let's start by tallying the first-choices.     A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   If this was a plurality election, B would be the winner with 8 first-choice votes.     Round 1  We make our first elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we eliminate E from the election. To transfer the 1 vote, we look at the person who voted for E in the last column. Their second choice was D, so we transfer that one vote to D, who will now have 8 votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 2  There are 24 votes in total, so a majority would be 13 votes. Since no candidate has the majority, we eliminate the next candidate with the fewest votes, which is A. We look at the column for the two people who chose A. Their second choice was E, who is already eliminated. Their third choice is B, so their 2 votes are transferred to B, for a total of 10:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 3  Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   Now we can see that D is the winner of the instant runoff method with 13 votes. We can stop this method earlier if a candidate reaches a majority.       The Instant Runoff Method is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter's order of preference is recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed quickly without requiring a second costly election. It also makes it safe to vote for a third-party candidate knowing that your vote will go to your second choice if your first choice can't win.  This voting method is used in several places around the world, including the election of members of the Australian House of Representatives, statewide elections in Maine, and local elections in Benton County, Oregon (Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, 2020).    Borda Count (Point System)  Borda Count is another voting method, named for Jean-Charles de Borda, who developed the system in 1770. In this method, points are assigned to each candidate based on their ranking; 1 point for last choice, 2 points for second-to-last choice, and so on. The point values are totaled, and the candidate with the largest point total is the winner. We'll show you how to do it in the next example.    A group of PCC students are getting together for a student leadership conference and they need to decide where to meet. Their members are from four campuses: Sylvania, Rock Creek, Cascade and Southeast. The votes for where to hold the conference were:    Number of voters  31  25  10  14    1st choice  Sylvania  Rock Creek  Southeast  Cascade    2nd choice  Southeast  Cascade  Cascade  Rock Creek    3rd choice  Rock Creek  Sylvania  Sylvania  Southeast    4th choice  Cascade  Southeast  Rock Creek  Sylvania    Now we will add a column on the left side of the table for the points. Then we multiply the points by the number of voters who put each candidate in that rank,    Points  Number of voters  31  25  10  14    4  1st choice  Sylvania  Rock Creek  Southeast  Cascade    3  2nd choice  Southeast  Cascade  Cascade  Rock Creek    2  3rd choice  Rock Creek  Sylvania  Sylvania  Southeast    1  4th choice  Cascade  Southeast  Rock Creek  Sylvania    We will start with Sylvania in the bottom row and move up. They have one point times 14 voters, 2 points times 25 + 10 voters, 3 points times zero, and 4 points times 31 voters. Multiplying and then adding gives us a total of 208 points for Sylvania. You can see the calculation below and we will do the same thing for each campus:     Sylvania: points    Rock Creek: points    Cascade: points    Southwest: points     Using the Borda count method, Rock Creek is the winning location.    Note that Sylvania would have won with the plurality method. Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can be used to choose a more broadly acceptable option over the one with the most first-choice support. This is a different approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus on first-choice votes; Borda Count considers every voter's entire ranking to determine the outcome.  Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used in awarding sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in baseball, to rank teams in NCAA sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.    Pairwise Comparison: Copeland's Method  Another method, called pairwise comparison , the Condorcet method or Copeland's method , attempts to be fair by looking at each pair of candidates separately.  In this method, we look at each pair as if they were the only two candidates running and determine which of the two is more preferred. In Copeland's method, the more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point. If there is a tie, each candidate is awarded point. After all the pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is declared the winner.  Variations of Copeland's Method are used in many professional organizations, including election of the Board of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.    Consider our class president example from the beginning of the chapter. Determine the winner using Copeland's Method.    Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O    We need to look at each pair of candidates to see which would win in a one-to-one comparison. First, we will systematically list all of the pairs of candidates:   Helena vs. Omar    Helena vs. Ana    Ana vs. Omar     Next, comparing Helena with Omar, we see that 6 voters, those marked in bold in the table below, would prefer Helena over Omar. Note that Helena doesn't have to be the voter's first choice – we're imagining that Ana wasn't in the race. The other 4 people chose Omar over Helena.    Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O    Based on this comparison of Helena vs. Omar, Helena wins 1 point.  Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.  To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:   Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)     Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland's Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn't choose Helena for their first choice.    Now that we've seen an example of each voting method, let's run through each method for the same scenario.    Consider an advertising team voting to choose one of four different slogans, labeled A, B, C and D. Determine the winner using each method we have learned.    Number of voters  5  3  6  4  2    1st choice  D  A  C  B  A    2nd choice  A  C  B  D  D    3rd choice  C  B  A  A  C    4th choice  B  D  D  C  B       Plurality Method: We tally the first-place votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:   C wins the plurality method.   Instant Runoff Method: We start with the plurality tallies. Then we look for the slogan with the least first-choice votes, and that is B. Looking in the preference schedule at the 4 people who voted for B, we see their second choice is D. So we transfer those 4 votes to D, which now has 9.    A:  B:  C:  D:   Now A has the least number of votes with 5, so we look at the voters who chose A for their first choice. There are two columns, so three of those votes will be transferred to C and 2 will be transferred to D.    A:  B:  C:  D:   D is the winner of the instant runoff method.   Borda Count: We add a column on the left for the points, starting with 1 point for last place and counting up. Then we multiply the points by the number of votes and add them all up.    Points  Number of voters  5  3  6  4  2    4  1st choice  D  A  C  B  A    3  2nd choice  A  C  B  D  D    2  3rd choice  C  B  A  A  C    1  4th choice  B  D  D  C  B       A: points    B: points    C: points    D: points     A is the winner of the Borda count method.   Pairwise Comparison:    First we list all the possible pairs:   A vs B    A vs C    A vs D    B vs C    B vs D    C vs D     Then we count the number of voters who would choose each candidate if they were the only two in the race.   A-10 vs B-10    A-14 vs C-6    A-11 vs D-9    B-4 vs C-16    B-13 vs D-7    C-9 vs D-11      Totaling one point for each win and half a point for each tie gives us:   A has 2.5 points    B has 1.5 points    C has 1 point    D has 1 point     A is the winner of the pairwise comparison method.      Which Method is the Most Fair?  To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below:    Number of voters  5  5  5    1st choice  A  C  B    2nd choice  B  A  C    3rd choice  C  B  A    Notice that in this election: 10 people prefer A to B, 10 people prefer B to C, and 10 people prefer C to A.  No matter whom we choose as the winner, of voters would prefer someone else! This scenario is called Condorcet's Voting Paradox . In this situation, there is no fair resolution. There are many additional paradoxes and fairness criteria that are explained in David Lippman's original version of Math in Society Math in Society: Voting Theory , by David Lippman .  Since it is not possible to have one method that is fair in every situation, it is important to decide which method is the most fair for any given situation.    Primaries and Sequential Voting  For many public offices in the U.S., a sequence of two public votes is held: a primary election and the general election. For non-partisan offices like sheriff and judge, in which political party affiliation is not declared, the primary election is usually used to narrow the field of candidates.  For partisan positions, typically, either the top two candidates receiving the most votes move forward, or the top candidate from each party will move forward. This is called sequential voting - a process in which voters cast totally new ballots after each round of eliminations. Sequential voting has become quite common in television, where it is used in reality shows like The Voice .  In some states a closed primary is used, in which only voters of each party can vote for that party's candidates. In other states, an open primary is used, where voters can pick the party whose primary they want to vote in. In other states, caucuses are used, which are meetings of the political parties, only open to party members. Closed primaries are often disliked by independent voters, who like the flexibility to change which party they are voting in. Open primaries have the disadvantage of raiding, though, where a voter could vote in their non-preferred party's primary with the intent of selecting a weaker opponent for their preferred party's candidate.  Regardless of the primary type, the general election is the main election. While rules vary state-to-state, for an independent or minor party candidate to get listed on the ballot, they typically have to gather a certain number of signatures to petition for inclusion.  In the next section we will look at a different type of election for the President of the United States.

A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   If this was a plurality election, B would be the winner with 8 first-choice votes.     Round 1  We make our first elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we eliminate E from the election. To transfer the 1 vote, we look at the person who voted for E in the last column. Their second choice was D, so we transfer that one vote to D, who will now have 8 votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 2  There are 24 votes in total, so a majority would be 13 votes. Since no candidate has the majority, we eliminate the next candidate with the fewest votes, which is A. We look at the column for the two people who chose A. Their second choice was E, who is already eliminated. Their third choice is B, so their 2 votes are transferred to B, for a total of 10:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 3  Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   Now we can see that D is the winner of the instant runoff method with 13 votes. We can stop this method earlier if a candidate reaches a majority.      "

Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.  To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:   Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)     Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland's Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn't choose Helena for their first choice.   "

  "title": "Apportionment",
  "body": " Apportionment    US Capitol Building: home of the House of Representatives   The United States Capitol Building    Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of things among groups of different sizes. In politics, this takes the form of allocating a limited number of representatives to constituent groups. This problem, presumably, is older than the United States, but the best-known ways to solve it have their origins in the problem of assigning each state an appropriate number of representatives in the new Congress when the country was formed. States also face this apportionment problem in defining how to draw districts for state representatives.  In this section, we apply four apportionment methods in social, economic, and political contexts, and compare the results.     Students will be able to:     Apportion items or representatives using the methods of Hamilton, Jefferson, and Webster.    Apportion items or representatives using the method of equal proportions.    Compare and contrast results of the four methods.      The Problem of Apportionment  The legislative, or law-making, branch of the United States government consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The members of the Senate are called senators, and the members of the House of Representatives are called congresspeople or representatives. Each state is represented by two senators and a number of congresspeople that is proportional to the population of the state.  While the total number of congresspeople has changed multiple times over the history of the United States, a public law established that from the year 1913 and onward, there would be exactly 435 representatives.  It sounds simple enough: a state with percent of the population should receive percent of the the representatives. The problem is that the calculations usually do not come out neat and simple. For example, Washington State residents make up about 2.325% of the US population, so they should have 2.325% of the 435 representatives. That is 10.11 people. Since 0.11 people doesn't make sense, Washington State receives 10 representatives. If we continue this approach and assign whole numbers of representatives to each state, we are very likely to end up with too few or too many representatives.  This same problem also arises in other contexts, such as figuring out how many school counselors each high school shoud have on staff, or disbursing stocks.  The requirements are as follows:   Apportionment Rules     The things being apportioned can only exist in whole numbers. (A state can't have, for example, 2.7 representatives.)    We must apportion exactly the number of things we have. (The total number of representatives must be exactly 435.)    Each group must get at least one of the things being apportioned. (Each state must get at least one representative.)    The number of things assigned to each group should be approximately proportional to the population of the group. (Each congressperson should represent close to the same number of people.)      In addition to the mathematical challenges of the calculations themselves, it is important to aknowledge that the population data being used may not be accurate. According the the Census Bureau, the 2020 census overcounted homeowners, non-hispanic white residents, and asian residents. It undercounted renters, black or African American residents, American Indian or Alaska Native residents, and Hispanic or Latio residents. US Census Bureau. (2022, March 10). Census Bureau releases estimates of Undercount and overcount in the 2020 census. Census.gov. www.census.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2022\/2020-census-estimates-of-undercount-and-overcount.html   Historically, undercounts were intentional: prior to 1868, each enslaved person was counted as 3 5 of a resident, and prior to 1940, census counts explicitly excluded people who were classified as \"Indians not taxed\", meaning Indigenous Americans living on reservations or unsettled lands.    Hamilton's Method  Alexander Hamilton proposed the method that now bears his name. His method was approved by Congress in 1791, but was vetoed by President Washington. It was later adopted in 1852 and used through 1911. He began by determining, to several decimal places, how many representatives each state should get. Then he used the size of the remainders and the total number of representatives to determine whether each state's apportionment should be \"rounded down\" or \"rounded up\". (We are using the terms \"round down\" and \"round up\" loosely here, as he did not follow traditional rounding rules.)   Hamilton's Method for Apportionment  For historical accuracy, we use the language of states and representatives in these steps. However, this method can be used in any application of apportionment.     Determine the divisor , which is the number of people each representative should represent. It is found by dividing the total population of the country by the number of representatives to be apportioned.    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. This number is called the quota .    Truncate (round down) each state's quota to a whole number, but be sure to keep a record of the original value. The truncated values are called the lower quotas .    Add the lower quotas and subtract from the total number of representatives to determine how many remain. Assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states in order of the size of the decimal portion of their quota. (Exception: if a state's lower quota is 0, they must receive an one of the remaining representatives even if the decimal portion does not warrant it.)        The state of Delaware has three counties: Kent, New Castle, and Sussex. The Delaware state House of Representatives has 41 members. If Delaware wants to divide this representation along county lines (which is not required, but let’s pretend they do), let’s use Hamilton’s method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows (from the 2020 Census):    County  Population    New Castle  570,719    Sussex  237,378    Kent  181,851    Total  989,948     Step 1: Find the divisor. Divide the total population 989,948 by the number of representatives, 41, to obtain 24,145.073. This number means that each representative should represent about 24,145 people. For accuracy, store the divisor in your calculator's memory or use a spreadsheet.   Step 2: Find each county's quota. Divide each county's population by the divisor, using either your calculator's memory or a cell reference in a spreadsheet.   Step 3: Find each county's lower quota. Truncate (round down) each county's quota. If using a spreadsheet, this can be accomplished quickly using the built-in formula, TRUNC. The results of steps 2 and 3 are as follows:    County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota    New Castle  570,719  23.63708  23    Sussex  237,378  9.831322  9    Kent  181,851  7.531599  7    Total  989,948  41     At this point, we can say that New Castle should have at least 23 representatives, Sussex should have at least 9, and Kent should have at least 7.   Step 4: Assign remaining representatives. Adding the lower quotas, we find that only 39 of the 41 have been assigned. The two remaining will be given to the counties whose quotas had the largest decimal portions.  The decimal portion for New Castle's quota is .63708, Sussex's is .831322, and Kent's is .531599. The two largest are New Castle and Sussex, so the two remaining representatives will be apportioned to these counties.

Then we divide the population to find that the devisor is about 14,631.72.

  "body": " The Popular Vote, Electoral College and Electoral Power    Students will be able to:     Calculate the number of electors per state    Determine the winner of the popular vote    Determine the winner of the electoral college    Calculate the electoral power of each state      Introduction goes here.    Choosing the U.S. President  In the last section we talked about equal voting rights and studied several voting methods. To choose the President of the United States, we use another method, called the Electoral College . The Founders, with their newfound freedom from Britain, wanted to create a democracy where citizens could participate in choosing their president. Prior to the Electoral College, there were three options proposed (Best, 2004; Clayton, 2015). They were   Congress would elect the president    State Legislatures would vote and elect the president    The people would elect a president by popular vote     The first option of having Congress do this work was declined as this would alter the balance of power among the three separate branches of government. The idea to have State Legislatures also failed as there wouldn't be the separation between having an independent Federal Government and State Governments.  The popular vote means a candidate must win a plurality of all the votes cast for president, regardless of which state the voters live in. The popular vote was decided against as the Founders didn't think all citizens would be informed enough about the candidates to make an educated decision (Clayton, 2015).  Instead, the Electoral College was decided upon and, in this system, each state was given a certain number of electoral votes. Each state got an equal two votes for the two senate seats. This gave smaller states a leg up as they would have at least these votes. In addition, each state would be given more votes based on their population, equal to their representation in the House (Clayton, 2015). The District of Columbia, which is not a state, also gets 3 electoral votes. A candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to win the U.S. presidency. If no candidate has a majority of electoral votes then a contingent election would be held by the U.S. House of Representatives between the three candidates with the most electoral votes.  The 4 million U.S. Citizens who live in the U.S. territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico cannot vote in the presidential elections and do not have any electors for the U.S. President. Additionally, there are U.S. Nationals in American Samoa and other territories that cannot vote. You can learn more about residents of these territories in this Census Bureau Report . We will also reiterate that voter suppression still exists and elections will not be truly fair until all of its forms are eliminated.  As stated in the Constitution, the U.S. currently has 435 representatives in the House. They each serve 2-year terms, while the two senators from each state serve 6-year terms.    How many electoral votes are there in the U.S. Electoral College?       By adding all the U.S. Senators, Representatives and 3 for Washington, D.C., we have a total of 538 electoral votes.      How many electoral votes does a candidate need to win to become the President of the United States?     then add one to get over 50%, which is 270.  A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. Presidency.      The number of people who voted in the presidential election in 2016 was 136,452,150 (Ballotpedia, n.d.). How many votes would be needed to win a majority of the popular vote?     then go to the next whole number which is 68,226,076.  A candidate would need 68,226,076 votes to win the popular vote.      There were approximately 230,931,921 eligible voters at the time of the 2016 election (McDonald, 2016). What percentage of eligible voters voted?       About 59% of all the eligible voters voted in the 2016 election.    If you are interested in the 2016 election voting rates by race, Hispanic origin and age, you can find them in this Census Bureau Report .    How Electoral Votes are Determined  While each state has a set number of electoral votes based on the formula above, the federal government gave states the control of how they distribute and cast their electoral votes (Paiva, 2011). In 48 states, the candidate with the most votes wins all of that state's electoral votes, often called winner-takes-all . In essence, a candidate could win with barely a majority of the popular vote in that state and the entire state's votes goes to that individual (Clayton, 2015). In 2 states, Maine and Nebraska, however, they use a district plan where instead of winner-takes-all, they use proportionality . This means that they award electoral votes by how individual districts vote. Each district gives their electoral vote to the winner of their district and the remaining two votes go to the candidate that won statewide.  There is a movement to change from the Electoral College to the popular vote. One way this is happening is through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact . States who adopt this compact agree to award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. If states and\/or D.C. with at least 270 electoral votes adopt this compact, then the winner of the popular vote would win the electoral college and the presidency. At this time there are 196 electoral votes in states and D.C. who have enacted the bill and the bill has passed one or two legislative houses in additional states with 88 electoral votes.  After citizens cast their votes by mail or on election day on the first Tuesday in November, electors gather in December and are responsible for casting the votes for their state. Electors cannot be elected officials and are chosen by their parties. Electors are expected to vote in alignment with the state they represent, but there have been faithless electors in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July of 2020 that states can penalize electors who do not vote according to the law of the state.  To see how the electoral college and popular votes work, we will look at a made-up country with a smaller number of states.    Consider this country with 4 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are the same as the U.S. government. Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070          Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.    How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election?    Determine which candidate wins the popular vote and the electoral college vote.    Write down all the possible combinations of states that would win the election based on the electoral college.    What is the fewest number of individual votes needed to win the Electoral College?    What is the smallest percentage of the population that you can win the Electoral College with?          To find the number of electors for each state, we first divide each state population by 40,000 to determine the number of representatives they will have. We will drop the decimal remainders, similar to Hamilton's method.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070           State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2     Medium  262,340  6  2     Large  581,135  14  2     Huge  862,070  34  2     Then we will add the number of representatives and the senators for each state.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2  5    Medium  262,340  6  2  8    Large  581,135  14  2  16    Huge  862,070  21  2  23    Totals  1,860,145  44  8  52    Now we can add up the total of all the electors from each state and we have:   electors.    To find out how many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election, we calculate a majority of 65 electors.   , add one to get 27 votes.  27 electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election in this state.    To find the winner for each method, we need the results of an election. In our example, there are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Given the votes for each candidate below, determine who wins the popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.    State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  130,082  132,258      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals        First, we will add up all the votes for each candidate in their columns. Next, we will look at each state individually to determine which candidate wins each state. Candidate B has more votes in Small, Medium and Large, so Candidate B gets all of the electoral votes in those states. Candidate A won Huge, so they get all of those electoral votes. We enter zero for the candidate who does not win in each state. Then we add up the electoral vote columns. Here is the completed table.    State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  130,082  132,258  0  8    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,011,073  849,072  23  29    Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.  There have been 5 U.S. presidential elections where the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral college. In all the other elections, the two methods agreed and would have elected the same candidate.  Try calculating the results if these were the votes instead:    State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  131,200  131,140      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals           State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  131,200  131,140  8  0    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,012,191  847,954  31  21     This time Candidate A won Medium and Huge. That gave them the electoral vote victory. Note that the race in Medium was very close, and we only changed 1,118 votes or 0.06% of the votes to Candidate A which gave them the Electoral College.  Opponents of the Electoral College system say that it causes candidates to focus on a few swing states, rather than campaigning equally in all states.    Let's look at which combinations of states the candidates could seek to win with.  Since 27 electoral votes are needed, we will list all the winning combinations starting with the smallest number of states to win. We see that a candidate must win either Huge or Large, because Small and Medium together are not enough votes to win.    Combination  Small, 5  Medium, 8  Large, 16  Huge, 23  Total    Huge + Small  5    23  28    Huge + Medium   8   23  31    Huge + Large    16  23  39    Huge + Small + Medium  5  8   23  36    Huge + Medium + Large   8  16  23  47    Huge + Small + Large  5   16  23  44    Large + Small + Medium  5  8  16   29    All States  5  8  16  23  52    From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.    To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let's look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small with 28 electoral votes. Let's see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.  For Huge:   , then go to the next whole number and get 431,036.  For Small:   , then go to the next whole number which is 77,301.     Let's also consider the next larger combination of 29 electoral votes: winning Small, Large and Medium, because their populations are smaller than the Huge state.  We found above that Small can be won with a bare majority of 77,301 people.  For Medium:   , then go to the next whole number which is 131,171.  For Large:   , then go to the next whole number which is 290,568.     A candidate can win with 499,040 votes in the combination of the Small, Large and Medium state.    The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 499,040. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get     If a candidate had the right combination of states in this made up country, they could win the Electoral College with only 26.8% of the vote.       People who support the Electoral College often say it protects small states. People who oppose the Electoral College often say that each person's vote should count equally as in the popular vote. Next we will look at electoral power to understand the impact of the Electoral College on people in small and large states.    Electoral Power   Electoral power is the value of a person's vote in one state compared to another state. A related topic is voting power, which is the probability of any one person influencing an election. If you are interested in voting power, you can look up the Banzhaf Power Index. To calculate the electoral power, we will calculate a ratio of electoral votes for a given number of people. We could use any number, so we will choose the number of people that each representative represents, which is our divisor of 40,000 people.    Using the same fictional country, use the table below to calculate the electoral power of each state.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600        Medium  262,340        Large  581,135        Huge  862,070        First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.  To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600  3  2  5     Medium  262,340  6  2  8     Large  581,135  14  2  16     Huge  862,070  21  2  23     Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don't make a very big difference.  You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as . Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.    A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.    The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.  Let's say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.    A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.    Now that we have studied the popular vote, the Electoral College and electoral power, we leave it up to you to choose which method you think is best.       How is the U.S. President selected?   The president is elected through a process called The Electoral College. States send a certain number of electors, based on their populations, and whichever candidate gets the most votes from these electors becomes president.    How many electors are there in the U.S. Electoral College?   There are 538 electors in the Electoral College.    How many U.S. Senators represent each state?   Two senators represent each state.    What is the length of a term of a U.S. Senator?   The term of a U.S. Senator is 6 years.    How many Representatives serve in the U.S. House of Representatives?   There are 435 Representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives.    What is the length of a term of a U.S. Representative?   The term of a U.S. Representative is 2 years.     In each fictional country in problems 7-10, use the rules of the U.S. government to complete the table and determine the following:     The total number of electors in the state.    The number of electoral votes needed for a majority and win a presidential election.       In this country there is one representative for every 50,000 residents.

  "body": "  Consider this country with 4 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are the same as the U.S. government. Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070          Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.    How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election?    Determine which candidate wins the popular vote and the electoral college vote.    Write down all the possible combinations of states that would win the election based on the electoral college.    What is the fewest number of individual votes needed to win the Electoral College?    What is the smallest percentage of the population that you can win the Electoral College with?          To find the number of electors for each state, we first divide each state population by 40,000 to determine the number of representatives they will have. We will drop the decimal remainders, similar to Hamilton's method.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070           State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2     Medium  262,340  6  2     Large  581,135  14  2     Huge  862,070  34  2     Then we will add the number of representatives and the senators for each state.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2  5    Medium  262,340  6  2  8    Large  581,135  14  2  16    Huge  862,070  21  2  23    Totals  1,860,145  44  8  52    Now we can add up the total of all the electors from each state and we have:   electors.    To find out how many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election, we calculate a majority of 65 electors.   , add one to get 27 votes.  27 electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election in this state.    To find the winner for each method, we need the results of an election. In our example, there are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Given the votes for each candidate below, determine who wins the popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.    State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  130,082  132,258      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals        First, we will add up all the votes for each candidate in their columns. Next, we will look at each state individually to determine which candidate wins each state. Candidate B has more votes in Small, Medium and Large, so Candidate B gets all of the electoral votes in those states. Candidate A won Huge, so they get all of those electoral votes. We enter zero for the candidate who does not win in each state. Then we add up the electoral vote columns. Here is the completed table.    State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  130,082  132,258  0  8    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,011,073  849,072  23  29    Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.  There have been 5 U.S. presidential elections where the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral college. In all the other elections, the two methods agreed and would have elected the same candidate.  Try calculating the results if these were the votes instead:    State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  131,200  131,140      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals           State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  131,200  131,140  8  0    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,012,191  847,954  31  21     This time Candidate A won Medium and Huge. That gave them the electoral vote victory. Note that the race in Medium was very close, and we only changed 1,118 votes or 0.06% of the votes to Candidate A which gave them the Electoral College.  Opponents of the Electoral College system say that it causes candidates to focus on a few swing states, rather than campaigning equally in all states.    Let's look at which combinations of states the candidates could seek to win with.  Since 27 electoral votes are needed, we will list all the winning combinations starting with the smallest number of states to win. We see that a candidate must win either Huge or Large, because Small and Medium together are not enough votes to win.    Combination  Small, 5  Medium, 8  Large, 16  Huge, 23  Total    Huge + Small  5    23  28    Huge + Medium   8   23  31    Huge + Large    16  23  39    Huge + Small + Medium  5  8   23  36    Huge + Medium + Large   8  16  23  47    Huge + Small + Large  5   16  23  44    Large + Small + Medium  5  8  16   29    All States  5  8  16  23  52    From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.    To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let's look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small with 28 electoral votes. Let's see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.  For Huge:   , then go to the next whole number and get 431,036.  For Small:   , then go to the next whole number which is 77,301.     Let's also consider the next larger combination of 29 electoral votes: winning Small, Large and Medium, because their populations are smaller than the Huge state.  We found above that Small can be won with a bare majority of 77,301 people.  For Medium:   , then go to the next whole number which is 131,171.  For Large:   , then go to the next whole number which is 290,568.     A candidate can win with 499,040 votes in the combination of the Small, Large and Medium state.    The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 499,040. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get     If a candidate had the right combination of states in this made up country, they could win the Electoral College with only 26.8% of the vote.      "

  "body": "  Using the same fictional country, use the table below to calculate the electoral power of each state.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600        Medium  262,340        Large  581,135        Huge  862,070        First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.  To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.    State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600  3  2  5     Medium  262,340  6  2  8     Large  581,135  14  2  16     Huge  862,070  21  2  23     Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don't make a very big difference.  You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as . Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.    A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.    The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.  Let's say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.    A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.    Now that we have studied the popular vote, the Electoral College and electoral power, we leave it up to you to choose which method you think is best.   "

How to Solve a Linear Equation     Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation, if needed, using the distributive property and\/or combining like terms.    Add or subtract terms from both sides of the equation until only one term has a variable attached, and that term is isolated on one side of the equation.    Multiply or divide both sides of the equation by the same number to solve for the variable.    Check that the solution is correct.        Solve        To check that the solution is correct, we can substitute into the original equation and ensure that it results in a true statement: Since 7=7 is true, we know that the solution is correct.

  "body": " Creating Graphs  There are several tools available for creating graphs of functions. We will provide instructions for Desmos , which is a free web-based graphing utility. Information about using Desmos with a screen reader and other accessibility tools is found on their accessibility page .    How to Create and Edit a Graph  The following general steps should be used when creating effective graphs:   Enter the equation, expression, or function in the expression list.    Adjust the bounds on the x-axis and y-axis as needed to ensure that the resulting graph shows all features of the function(s) over a realistic time interval.    If appropriate, add descriptive labels for the axes.   Note that step 2 can also be achieved with a touchscreen or mouse and keyboard. On a touchscreen, use the pinch and spread gestures with your fingers touching the axes. Alternatively, hold down the shift key on the keyboard while clicking and dragging the mouse on the axes.    Graphing with Desmos   The functions and model the value in dollars of two different investments after years. Please do not be confused by the use of subscripts 1 and 2 on the function names; their purpose is simply to distinguish between the two functions.  Create a single graph showing and . There are two intersection points: be sure that both are visible in the graph.     Step 1: Enter the functions. In the Desmos graphing calculator, we enter one equation into the expression line. Hitting enter or clicking in the space directly below the expression line brings up another line where we enter the other equation as seen below.   Screenshot from Desmos. Both equations are entered, but the graph shows only a portion of one line.  Step 2: Adjust the bounds on the axes. We click on the wrench icon to access the Graph Settings menu in Desmos. Then, through experimentation, we adjust the intervals for the x- and y-axes until the graph shows both functions and both of the points where they intersect. (This can also be done using pinch and spread gestures on a touchscreen or holding down the Shift key while clicking and dragging on an axis.)   Step 3: Add labels. In the Graph Settings menu, we type labels in the boxes provided. The x-axis label is \"Time (yrs)\" and the y-axis label is \"Value ($)\".  To use the graph in a document or submit in an assignment, we click on the export icon that looks like a box with a curved arrow pointing out of it. The \"Export Image\" option allows the graph to be downloaded as a picture file. The resulting graph is shown below.   Horizontal axis shows values between 0 and 200 and is labeled Time (yrs). Vertical axis shows values between 0 and 4000 and is labeled Value ($). There is a increasing linear function and an increasing exponential function. They intersect at (0,100) and near (180, 3800).   In the resulting graph, the straight-line is the graph of and the curve is the graph of .     In mathematics, we use the term graph very broadly to refer to to indicate both the entire image and the individual curves inside of the graph. In the previous example, the resulting graph contains the graphs of and .   "

For example, if you have defined , you can type and hit Enter to find that value.   Solve an Equation: Solutions to equations are represented graphically by intersection points. If you are solving an equation of the form , the solutions are the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of and intersect.   Fish population   The population of an invasive fish species in a pond follows the logistic growth function where is the number of fish in the pond at time in months after a few of the fish were accidentally introduced into the ecosystem.     Find the population after 10 months.    After how many months will the population reach 100 fish?          To find the population after 10 months, we need to evaluate . (We know that because 10 years is a time, which is a value; we are replacing with 10. In Desmos, we enter on an expression line and hit Enter. On the next expression line, or any available expression line, we type and hit Enter. The value 11.2625288342 appears. Rounding to the nearest whole fish, we conclude that there were about 11 fish in the pond after 10 months.    To determine how many months it will take the population to reach 100 fish, we will solve the equation . (We know to do this because 100 is a number of fish, which is a value, so we are replacing the output with 100. That is found by determining where the graphs of and intersect. We already have the graph of displayed from the previous part of this example. On a new expression line, we input and adjust the viewing rectangle in the graph until we can see where the two graphs intersect. Clicking on the intersection point brings up the coordinates of the point, . Recall that we are looking for the time, or value, which is about months.      Desmos screenshot showing the work done to solve the problem.      Projectile Motion   The function models the height in feet of a pumpkin at time seconds after it is launched from a trebuchet. Use graphing technology to determine the following:   Find the initial height of the pumpkin.    Find the height of the pumpkin after seconds.    After how many seconds does the pumpkin reach its maximum height, and what is the maximum height?    After how many seconds does the pumpkin land on the ground, which is a height of feet?       We begin by creating a graph of the function and the line ; then we adjust the viewing rectange to show the maximum height and the intercepts.   Graph of y=-16x^2+64x+5, a downward-facing parabola. The coordinates of the vertex or highest point are labeled (2,69) and the coordinates of the x-intercept to the right of the vertex are labeled (4.07660,0).   Now we can use the graph to answer the questions.     The initial height of the pumpkin is feet above the ground.    After 3 seconds, the pumpkin is at a height of feet above the ground.    The highest point on the graph corresponds to its maximum. The coordinates of this point are . The x-coordinate is the time, so we can say that the pumpkin reaches its maximum height after 2 seconds. The y-coordinate is the height, so we can say that the maximum height is 69 feet.    The time when the pumpkin lands on the ground is the x-coordinate of one of the points where the graph intersects the line , which is the x-axis. This is because the height of the ground is 0 feet. There are two such points, but we may disregard the point with a negative x-value since we are not going backward in time. Therefore, the time when it lands is seconds.        Home Value   A home was purchased for $350,000 in 2016. If home values in the area have been increasing by 9% per year according to an exponential model, when will the home be worth $1,000,000?    For simplicity, we will measure time in years since 2012 and the value will be measured in thousands of dollars.  Using an exponential model of the form with and , we obtain the function .  The time when the value reaches $1,000,000 is the solution to the equation . To find this solution, we will graph and ; then find where the graphs intersect.   Graph of intersection of two curves. The intersection point is labeled (12.18206,1000).   The two functions intersect where which is the year . Therefore, the home will be worth $1,000,000 in the year 2028.    "
